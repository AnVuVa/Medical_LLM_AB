Significant esophageal injury occurs in 15% of patients with no oropharyngeal injury, while 70% of patients with oropharyngeal injury have no esophageal damage. Signs of airway injury or imminent obstruction warrant close observation and possibly tracheostomy. The risk of adding injury, particularly in a child, makes esophagoscopy contraindicated in the opinion of most surgeons. Administration of oral \"antidotes\" is ineffective unless given within moments of ingestion; even then, the additional damage potentially caused by the chemical reactions of neutralization often makes use of them unwise. A barium esophagogram is usually done within 24 h unless evidence of perforation is present. In most reports, steroids in conjunction with antibiotics reduce the incidence of formation of strictures from about 70% to about 15%. Vomiting should be avoided, if possible, to prevent further corrosive injury and possible aspiration. It is probably wise to avoid all oral intake until the full extent of injury is ascertained.The most helpful ECG finding is the presence of a new right bundle branch block, which occurs because of damage to the anterior portion of the interventricular septum; ST-segment and T-wave changes and even the development of new Q waves may be seen. CPK-MB fractions are useful if they are positive; however, frequent false negatives may be seen because of the release of CPK-MM from other contused organs, such as the pectoralis muscles, which can dilute the cardiac CPK-MB to nondiagnostic levels. Echocardiography may be helpful, but the right ventricle is often poorly visualized. Radionuclide angiography is most useful because it suggests the degree of myocardial impairment caused by decreased compliance.Therapy of myocardial contusion is directed at inotropic support of the ventricle; usually, the coronary arteries are intact after the injury and so there is little role for coronary vasodilators and less for coronary artery bypass grafting.", "subject_name": "Surgery", "topic_name": "Heart & Pericardium"}

Intravascular thrombosis with associated dystrophic calcification is common. They may be locally destructive, so surgical excision may be required in some cases. More often the tumors are of little clinical significance, but they can be cosmetically troublesome and are vulnerable to traumatic ulceration and bleeding. Moreover, cavernous hemangiomas detected by imaging studies may be difficult to distinguish from their malignant counterpas. Brain hemangiomas also are problematic, as they can cause symptoms related to compression of adjacent tissue or rupture.Cavernous hemangiomas constitute one component of von Hippel-Lindau disease , in which vascular lesions are commonly found in the cerebellum, brain stem, retina, pancreas, and liver.

Therefore, in a thin-walled viscus, P = T divided by the two principal radii of curvature of the viscus: P = T(1/r1 + 1/r2) In a sphere, r1 = r2, so P=2T/r In a cylinder such as a blood vessel, one radius is infinite, so P = T/r Ref: Ganong's Review of medical physiology 25th edition. Page:574 This law helps to understand the physiological nechanisms in altered situations and pathological conditions . Eg: in hollow organs like bladder,ventricle,or alveoli of lungs the wall tension increases when the organ gets fillled ie P rises or the cavity size (R) increases. In ventricular hyperophy, the wall is thick so,wall tension is less. In dialated hea as in hea failure, more energy is required to pump blood as the wall tension is more(increased R) .

It has two main phases : Ventricular systole and ventricular diastole.Ventricular systole tor simply systole)o The systolic phase is divided into : -Isovolumetric contraction : As the ventricular contraction starts, the intraventricular pressure begins to rise, leading to an abrupt closure of AV valves (mitral and tricuspid valves). The closure of AV valves produces first heart sound (S1). the pressure is not enough to push open the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) but causes the closed AV valve to bulge into the atrium, causing a small but sharp rise in atrial pressure called the 'C' wave on jugular venous pulse (JVP). Because both the valves (AV valves an semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i.e., there is isovolumetric (isometric) contraction. Isovolumetric contraction ends with opening of semilunar (aortic and pulmonary ) valves.Ventricular ejection : When the steeply rising ventricular pressure exceeds the pressure in aorta and pulmonary artery, the semilunar valves open and ventricular ejection begins. The ejection of blood is rapid at first (rapid ejection phase), but slows down during later part of systole (slow ejection phase). During rapid ejection phase, when the ventricles contract, the fibrous partition separating the ventricles from the atria (the AV ring) is pulled down. As a result, the atrial muscles get stretched and the atria dilate which causes a sharp fall in atrial pressure and the X-descent in JVP.Protodiastole : In this very short phase, ventricles start relaxing and ventricular pressure begins to fall very sharply but the semilunar valves are still open. As a result, the column of blood in aorta (or pulmonary artery for right ventricle) tries to fall into the ventricle, hitting on its way the semilunar (aortic or pulmonary) valves. This causes closure of the aortic/pulmonary valves w hich produces 2nd heart sound (S2). The venous blood flow continues to flow in the atria from great veins (SVC and ICC) and there is relaxation of fibrous AV ring due to ventricular relaxation; both of which cause a rise in atrial pressure and production of 'V' wave in JVP.Ventricular diastole (or simply diastole)o The diastole phase is divided into : -Isovolumetric relaxation : - This phase is the period between the closure of semilunar valve and opening of the AV valve. The ventricles continue relaxing and there pressure continues to fall. However, as both valves (AV valves and semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i.e., isovolumetric relaxation. Relaxation phase ends w ith opening of AV valve.Rapid ventricular filling : - When the ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure, AV valves open and the accumulated blood in the atria rushes into the ventricle very rapidly. This passive filling contributes to 70% of ventricular filling, normally. This results in a sharp fall in atrial pressure which produces Y descent in JVP.Diastasis : - After the initial rapid ventricular filling, blood flow's slowly and smoothly from the SVC and IVC through the right atrium into the right ventricle without any turbulence anywhere along the path. Similarly, blood from the pulmonary' veins flows into the left ventricle without any turbulence. This phase of nonturbulent ventricular filling is called diastasis. The atrial pressure remains slightly greater than the ventricular pressure because inflow' to atrium exceeds the outflow the atrium.Last rapid filling phase (atrial systole) : - The atria contract and pump blood rapidly into the ventricles.Atrial systole is associated with sharp rise in atrial pressure which produces a-wave in JVP.", "subject_name": "Physiology", "topic_name": "Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

There is a linear hyperlucent margin along the left cardiac border, suggesting an air-soft tissue interface. This is seen in pneumopericardium. The chest x-ray shows a pneumopericardium. This refers to the presence of air within the pericardial sac. Pathologically, air can enter the pericardium from the mediastinum near the pulmonary veins. Air can also develop within the pericardium due to production by gas-forming organisms in cases of infection. At times the pneumopericardium may be complicated by the presence of fluid (hydropneumopericardium) or pus (pyopneumopericardium). Closed chest injury with or without perforation of the pericardium is the most frequent nonsurgical cause associated with this kind of pattern. Contiguous organ involvement (pulmonary abscess, bronchogenic carcinoma, esophagitis, perforated gastric ulcer, foreign body) also can result in the involvement of the pericardium and hence cause pneumopericardium. Septicemia causing direct seeding of the pericardial space can also produce a common communication with the lung. With pneumopericardium, the lucent halo of air paially or completely surrounds the hea but does not extend superiorly to the attachments of the pericardium, and the concomitant subcutaneous emphysema is absent. If supine and erect radiographs are obtained, pericardial air will immediately shift in location whereas mediastinal air change will not occur.The \"continuous diaphragm sign\" is seen in pneumomediastinum. In this sign, the right and the left hemidiaphragms appear continuous due to mediastinal air present along the diaphragm and below the hea, giving the appearance of a single continuous diaphragm. Both adults and children can develop life-threatening cardiac tamponade due to pneumopericardium. A pericardial rub is a sign of pericarditis and is usually not heard once an effusion develops. The Hamman sign is a crunching noise heard with the apex beat and heard best in the left lateral decubitus position. It is seen in 50% of cases of mediastinal emphysema (pneumomediastinum) and is associated with subcutaneous emphysema in the suprasternal notch.

Otherwise only correct answer is calcium. Thrombosthenin is involved in clot retraction.Platelet-associated factor XIII provides a means by which to promote clot stabilization and platelet interaction with proteins of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways.Fibrin stabilising factor (factor XIII) which is normally present in the plasma and also released from activated platelets is activated by thrombin to form XIIla but the XIIIa in the prescence of Ca2+ causes formation of covalent crosslinkages between fibrin threads, thus adding tremendous strength to the fibrin meshwork. The fibrin meshwork traps the remaining components of plasma and blood cells to form a solid mass called clotThrombomodulin is a thrombin binding protein produced by all endothelial cells except those in cerebral microcirculation.lt converts thrombin into protein C activator (AIPGME2007)Thrombasthenin is a contractile protein present in platelet involved in clot retraction and not in stabilizationActivated factor XIII will bind to the surface of activated platelets. These platelets then participate in cell-cell or cell-clot interactions, thereby increasing the local concentration of factor XIIIa.The platelet-associated factor Xllla may increase the amount of crosslinking in a fibrin clot, thereby contributing to the aging of the clot and the reduction in the degree of platelet binding. Clot resistance to fibrinolysis is enhanced by platelet factor XEIIa-mediated crosslinking of alpha 2-antiplasmin to fibrin. The binding of factor XIIIa to the platelet surface requires the activation of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein Ilb-IIIa.Thus, platelet-associated factor Xllla may be used as a marker of in vivo platelet activation. Since half of the factor XIII present in blood is provided by the platelets, it is not surprising that this form of factor XIII plays an important role in hemostasis.", "subject_name": "Physiology", "topic_name": "Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

Ca2+ influx through more slowly opening Ca2+ channels (the Ca2+ current, ICa) produces the plateau phase, and repolarization is due to net K+ efflux through multiple types of K+ channels.# Recorded extracellularly, the summed electrical activity of all the cardiac muscle fibers is the ECG.In phase 4 of action potential of cardiac muscle there exists a constant resting membrane potential of -85 to -90 mV. In pacemaker (SA node) fibres, however, the resting membrane potential is only of - 55 to -60. - Textbook Of Medical Physiology by Indu Khurana - Pg. 258.Salient features of pacemaker potential# The action potentials in the SA and AV nodes are largely due to Ca2+, with no contribution by Na+ influx.# Consequently there is no sharp, rapid depolarizing spike before the plateau, as there is in other parts of the conduction system and the atrial and ventricular fibers.# These are of two types in the heart, the T (for transient) channels and the L (for long-lasting) channels.# The calcium current (ICa) due to opening of T channels completes the prepotential, and ICa due to opening of L channels produces the impulse.Educational Table:MCQsAnsResting membrane potential depends onECF K+Resting membrane potentialEquilibrium potential of Cl-In resting and excitable tissues the most diffusible ion isCl-In resting and excitable tissues the least diffusible ion isNa+Magnitude of action potential is affected byECF Na+ ionsFreely permeable isWaterMost diffusible substance isUrea", "subject_name": "Physiology", "topic_name": "Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

The fluid expressed is called serum because all its fibrinogen and most of the other clotting factors have been removed; in this way, serum differs from plasma. Serum cannot clot because it lacks these factors. Platelets are necessary for clot retraction to occur. Therefore, failure of clot retraction is an indication that the number of platelets in the circulating blood might be low.\"Additional educational point:# Tissue factor initiates the extrinsic pathway, whereas contact of Factor XII and platelets with collagen in the vascular wall initiates the intrinsic pathway.# An especially important difference between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways is that the extrinsic pathway can be explosive; once initiated, its speed of completion to the final clot is limited only by the amount of tissue factor released from the traumatized tissues and by the quantities of Factors X, VII, and V in the blood. With severe tissue trauma, clotting can occur in as little as 15 seconds.

The Korotkoff sound method tends to give values for systolic pressure that are lower than the true intra-aerial pressure, and diastolic values that are higher. There is general consensus that the fifth phase or disappearance of sound should be taken as DBP, except in situations in which the disappearance of sounds cannot reliably be determined because sounds are audible even after complete deflation of the cuff, for example, in pregnant women, patients with aeriovenous fistulas and aoic insufficiency. The \"ideal\" cuff should have a bladder length that is 80% and a width that is at least 40% of arm circumference (a length-to-width ratio of 2:1). Cuff should be tied at the level of hea. Due to gravitational force BP decreases above the hea and increases below the hea by 0.77 mm Hg/cm. For this reason, when measurements are taken in the supine position the arm should be suppoed with a pillow. In the sitting position, the right atrium level is the midpoint of the sternum or the fouh intercostal space. The lower end of the cuff should be 2 to 3 cm above the antecubital fossa to allow room for placement of the stethoscope. Recommended deflation rate: 2 to 3 mm Hg per second Blood pressure is measure falsely high when the cuff is too small relative to the patient's arm circumference. At the initial visit, blood pressure should be measured in both arms. The patient should be instructed to relax as much as possible and to not talk during the measurement procedure; ideally, 5 minutes should elapse before the first reading is taken. In older patients with a wide pulse pressure, the Korotkoff sounds may become inaudible between systolic and diastolic pressure, and reappear as cuff deflation is continued.

Diminution of a femoral and/or popliteal pulse can often be appreciated by comparing it with its opposite number; however, pedal pulses are either clinically palpable or absent. Popliteal pulses are often difficult to feel; a popliteal aery aneurysm should be suspected if the popliteal pulse is prominent with concomitant loss of the natural concavity of the popliteal fossa. Pulsation distal to an aerial occlusion is usually absent although the presence of a highly developed collateral circulation may allow distal pulses to be palpable - this is most likely to occur with an iliac stenosis. In this case, exercise (walking until claudication develops) usually causes the pulse to disappear as vasodilation occurs below the obstruction, causing the pulse pressure to reduce. An aerial bruit, heard on auscultation over the pulse, indicates turbulent flow and suggests a stenosis. It is an unreliable clinical sign as tight stenoses often do not have bruits. A continuous 'machinery' murmur over an aery usually indicates an aeriovenous fistula.

B. Reduced plasma colloidal osmotic pressure. (Ref. Ganong 23rd/pg. 592 - 594)# Net fluid movement depends on net driving pressure and two other important factors related to the properties of the membranes. The filtration coefficient ,Kf, depends on the surface area and the permeability of the capillary wall to water (hydraulic conductivity). Leaky capillaries (e.g., due to histamine) have a high Kf. Glomerular capillaries have a high Kf, needed for their function.# The potential causes of pulmonary edema and pleural effusion are increases in capillary hydrostatic pressure, increases in interstitial colloid osmotic pressure, decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Edema due to hydrostatic pressure is called cardiogenic edema. Edema due to osmotic pressure and membrane properties is called non- cardiogenic pulmonary edema.Fluid Filtration Across Capillaries Is Determined by Hydrostatic and Colloid Osmotic Pressures, and Capillary Filtration CoefficientFour primary forces that determine whether fluid will move out of the blood into the interstitial fluid or in the opposite direction. These forces, called \"Starling forces \" in honor of the physiologist who first demonstrated their importance:1) The capillary pressure (Pc), which tends to force fluid outward through the capillary membrane.2) The interstitial fluid pressure (Pif), which tends to force fluid inward through the capillary membrane when Pif is positive but outward when Pif is negative.3) The capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure (Pp), which tends to cause osmosis of fluid inward through the capillary membrane.4) The interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (Pif), which tends to cause osmosis of fluid outward through the capillary membrane.If the sum of these forces, the net filtration pressure, is positive, there will be a net fluid filtration across the capillaries. If the sum of the Starling forces is negative, there will be a net fluid absorption from the interstitial spaces into the capillaries. Net filtration from systemic capillaries is dependent on the Starling forces and capillary permeability. Equation is:Net filtration = Kf where Kf is the filtration coefficient of the membrane, and is directly proportional to capillary permeability, Pcapillary and Ptissue are the hydrostatic pressures in the capillary and tissue (interstitial space), respectively, and pcapillary and ptissue are the osmotic (colloid oncotic) pressures in the capillary and interstitial space, respectively. Increasing central venous pressure increases the capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pcapillary), which increases the filtration of fluid from the systemic capillaries, leading to edema.The movement of fluid between vascular and interstitial spaces is controlled mainly by the opposing effects of vascular hydrostatic pressure and plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Normally, the exit of fluid into the interstitium from the arteriolar end of the microcirculation is nearly balanced by inflow at the venular end; the lymphatics drain a small residual amount of excess interstitial fluid. Either increased capillary pressure or diminished colloid osmotic pressure can result in increased interstitial fluid,n Increased Hydrostatic PressureLocalized increases in intravascular pressure can result from impaired venous return; if the failing heart cannot increase cardiac output, the extra fluid load causes increased venous pressure and, eventually, edema.# Reduced Plasma Osmotic PressureCapillary hydrostatic and osmotic forces are normally balanced so that there is no net loss or gain of fluid across the capillary bed. However, increased hydrostatic pressure or diminished plasma osmotic pressure leads to a net accumulation of extravascular fluid (edema). If the ability of the lymphatics to drain tissue fluid is exceeded, persistent tissue edema results.# Effect of Abnormal Imbalance of Forces at the Capillary MembraneIf the mean capillary pressure rises above 17 mm Hg, the net force tending to cause filtration of fluid into the tissue spaces rises. Thus, a 20 mm Hg rise in mean capillary pressure causes an increase in net filtration pressure from 0.3 mm Hg to 20.3 mm Hg, which results in 68 times as much net filtration of fluid into the interstitial spaces as normally occurs. To prevent accumulation of excess fluid in these spaces would require 68 times the normal flow of fluid into the lymphatic system, an amount that is 2 to 5 times too much for the lymphatics to carry away. As a result, fluid will begin to accumulate in the interstitial spaces, and edema will result.Conversely, if the capillary pressure falls very low, net reabsorption of fluid into the capillaries will occur instead of net filtration, and the blood volume will increase at the expense of the interstitial fluid volume.Note: Approximately 60% of lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular and the remainder is in extracellular compartments, mostly as interstitial fluid; only 5% of total body water is in blood plasma.", "subject_name": "Physiology", "topic_name": "Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

Left (or right) anterior thoracotomy is easily performed, especially in the emergency room, and gives adequate exposure to ceain areas of the hea. However, each has significant limitations in exposure. Either may be extended across the thoracotomy into the other side of the chest, thus producing a bilateral anterior thoracotomy. Exposure is excellent through this incision, and most injuries can be satisfactorily repaired through this approach. Most cardiac operations today are performed through median sternotomy incisions. If the patient is in the operating room, this incision is easily performed and always provides excellent exposure for all areas of the hea.", "subject_name": "Surgery", "topic_name": "Cardio thoracic surgery  "}
