Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.","subject_name":"Anaesthesia","topic_name":"Anesthesia for Cardiovascular Disease and Surgery"}

ICP- intra cranial pressure Head injury causes increased ICP thus lowering CPP causing ischemia. When ICP approaches the level of mean systemic pressure , cerebral perfusion falls .

Both atria have receptors that are affected by changes in blood volume and that influence the hea rate. These receptors are located principally in the venoatrial junctions: in the right atrium at its junctions with the venae cavae and in the left atrium at its junctions with the pulmonary veins. Distention of these atrial receptors sends afferent impulses to the brainstem in the vagus nerves. The efferent impulses are carried from the brainstem to the SA node by fibers from both autonomic divisions. Bezold-Jarisch reflex or the coronary chemoreflex: Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers in the cardiopulmonary region (eg, juxtacapillary region of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary aery) causes profound bradycardia, hypotension, and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. It can be elicited by a variety of substances including capsaicin, histamine, serotonin, phenylbiguanide, and veratridine. In human this reflex may be activated: During myocardial ischemia or, reperfusion (thrombolytic therapy) as a result of increased production of oxygen radicals. By agents used as radiocontrast for coronary angiography. It is cardioprotective by producing bradycardia, thus reduce the amount substances get absorbed into the blood Vasovagal syncope has been attributed to activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex J reflex or pulmonary chemoreflex: Because the C fiber endings are close to pulmonary vessels, they have been called J (juxtacapillary) receptors. They are stimulated by hyperinflation of the lung, but they respond as well to intravenous or intracardiac administration of chemicals such as capsaicin. The reflex response that is produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia, and hypotension Oculocardiac reflex: Traction on the extraocular muscles (especially the medial rectus), conjunctiva, or orbital structures causes hypotension and a reflex slowing of the HR, as well as arrhythmias Cushing's reflex: Increased CSF pressure (intracranial pressure) - cerebral aery compressed - CNS ischemia that causes hypoxia and hypercapnia in medulla, which directly stimulates the vasomotor centre - increased BP - baroreceptor mechanisms causes reflex Bradycardia.

The coronary blood flow\" goes to zero just prior to ventricular ejection, corresponding to isovolumic contraction and increased extravascular compression. Conversely, coronary blood flow through the left side is maximal during blood flow through the right side, however, is maximal during peak systole, because developed pressure and consequently extravascular compression within the RV are considerably less than in the LV, thus allowing for antegrade flow during both systole and diastole","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Circulation: Coronary Circulation and Ischemic Heart Disease"}

When there is rupture of the chordae tendinae or the papillary muscle itself, the mitral valve is unable to function properly, resulting in mitral regurgitation. Because this is an acute process, accommodation does not occur, resulting in acute pulmonary edema. Edema predominantly affecting the right upper lobe can be seen if the jet of regurgitant blood is directed into the right superior pulmonary vein, which drains the right upper lobe. The left atrium will enlarge over time in the setting of mitral valve regurgitation due to the increased volume of blood that is directed into the left atrium during systole. However, this change occurs over time and will not be seen in the setting of acute papillary muscle rupture. The left ventricle will enlarge oveime in the setting of mitral valve regurgitation because it receives an increased volume of blood from the left atrium - both the volume of blood returning from the lung as well as the regurgitant volume of blood through the mitral valve. As with left atrial enlargement, left ventricular enlargement will occur over time but will not be seen in the setting of acute papillary muscle rupture. Pericardial effusion can occur in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction due to inflammation of the pericardium. Dressler syndrome, thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response to myocardial neo-antigens, is not an acute process and, when present, occurs several weeks following a myocardial infarction.

QRS wave complexThe three waves of the QRS complex represent ventricular depolarization. For the inexperienced, one of the most confusing aspects of ECG reading is the labeling of these waves. The rule is: if the wave immediately after the P wave is an upward deflection, it is an R wave; if it is a downward deflection, it is a Q wave:i. small Q waves correspond to depolarization of the interventricular septum. Q waves can also relate to breathing and are generally small and thin. They can also signal an old myocardial infarction (in which case they are big and wide)ii. the R wave reflects depolarization of the main mass of the ventricles -hence it is the largest waveiii. the S wave signifies the final depolarization of the ventricles, at the base of the heartd.

This results in pressure difference between two arms.o The main reason for symptoms in coarctation of Aorta is interruption of blood supply to the organs located distally to obstructiono Very little of the left ventricle output reaches the descending Aorta.o The symptoms are weak pulses and lower blood pressure in the lower extremities associated with manifestations of arterial insufficiency (i.e., claudication and coldness).o Physical examination shows delayed or weak impalpable femorals compared to strong brachial arteries.o Collateral circulation develops between the precoarctation arterial branches and the postcoarctation arteries through enlarged intercostal and internal mammary arteries.o This produces the radiologically visible erosions (notching) of the undersurface of ribs.o Initially when the narrowing is not very severe the blood flowing through the obstruction produces mid systolic murmur passing through the anterior part of chest, back and spinous process, But when the lumen is sufficiently narrowed, the blood flowing across it results in, high velocity jet across the lesion throughout the cardiac cycle resulting in continuous murmur.o Although coarctation of Aorta may occur as solitary defect, it is accompanied by Biscuspid aortic valve in 50% cases. The Biscuspid valve produces Aortic regurgitation and this results in diastolic murmur seen in coarctation of Aorta.o In coarctation of Aorta unless the hypertension is very severe or left ventricular failure has ensued, cardiac output responds normally to exercise.o Coarctation of Aorta is characterized by Hypertension.Pathophysiology of Hypertension in Coarctation of Aorta.o In coarctation of Aorta the narrowing is typically found just after the vessels are given off to the left arm.o This leads to diminished blood supply in organs distal to the narrowing.o There is diminished blood supply to the kidney. So the kidney releases renin to compensate for the diminished blood supply. But the renin release leads to hypertension in organs which originally had normal B.P.o In this way heart and brain are subjected to very high pressures caused due low blood supply to kidney. The hypertension produces headache and dizziness.Treatment of coarctation of Aorta:o Coarctations generally require repair. Dilating the segment with balloons is a possibility, particularly in the young.o Surgical removal of the narrowed segment needs to be accomplished. If allowed to persist, the high blood pressure which is induced may become \"permanent\" even after removal of the narrowed segment, due to changes in some organs which are irreversible.o In coarctation of Aorta constriction of the Aorta occurs distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.o So the blood supply of the organs supplied by Aortic segment before the constriction is normal where as the blood supply of the organs supplied by portion of Aorta distal to the constriction is reduced.o This causes marked difference in blood supply between the upper and lower parts of the body.o The pulses and the pressure is greater in upper extremities compared to the pressure and pulses in lower extremities.o On physical examination there is delay in the femoral pulse.o The reduced blood supply in lower extremities produces manifestations of arterial insufficiency i.e., claudication and coldness.Murmur in Coarctation of Aortao The blood passing through the narrowed Aorta produces midsystolic murmur which can be heard over the anterior part of the chest back and spinous process.o When the lumen becomes severely narrowed the blood flow through it, turns in to a high velocity jet which produces continuous systolic murmur.The chest radiographNotching of undersurface of ribso Compensatory collaterals develop between the precoarctation arterial branches and postcoarctation arteries through the enlarged intercostal and internal mammary arteries.o These produces the radiologically visible erosions (\"notching\") of the undersurface of ribs.\"3\" Signo The characteristic \"3\" sign of the coarctation of Aorta is produced due to indentation or constriction of Aorta at the site of coarctation and pre and post stenotic dilatation of Aorta.","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Diseases of the Aorta"}

Significant esophageal injury occurs in 15% of patients with no oropharyngeal injury, while 70% of patients with oropharyngeal injury have no esophageal damage. Signs of airway injury or imminent obstruction warrant close observation and possibly tracheostomy. The risk of adding injury, particularly in a child, makes esophagoscopy contraindicated in the opinion of most surgeons. Administration of oral \"antidotes\" is ineffective unless given within moments of ingestion; even then, the additional damage potentially caused by the chemical reactions of neutralization often makes use of them unwise. A barium esophagogram is usually done within 24 h unless evidence of perforation is present. In most reports, steroids in conjunction with antibiotics reduce the incidence of formation of strictures from about 70% to about 15%. Vomiting should be avoided, if possible, to prevent further corrosive injury and possible aspiration. It is probably wise to avoid all oral intake until the full extent of injury is ascertained.The most helpful ECG finding is the presence of a new right bundle branch block, which occurs because of damage to the anterior portion of the interventricular septum; ST-segment and T-wave changes and even the development of new Q waves may be seen. CPK-MB fractions are useful if they are positive; however, frequent false negatives may be seen because of the release of CPK-MM from other contused organs, such as the pectoralis muscles, which can dilute the cardiac CPK-MB to nondiagnostic levels. Echocardiography may be helpful, but the right ventricle is often poorly visualized. Radionuclide angiography is most useful because it suggests the degree of myocardial impairment caused by decreased compliance.Therapy of myocardial contusion is directed at inotropic support of the ventricle; usually, the coronary arteries are intact after the injury and so there is little role for coronary vasodilators and less for coronary artery bypass grafting.","subject_name":"Surgery","topic_name":"Heart & Pericardium"}

Other disorders sometimes associated with hyperparathyroidism include peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and bone disease; central nervous system symptoms may also arise in connection with hyperparathyroidism. Occasionally, parathyroid adenomas occur in conjunction with neoplasms of other endocrine organs, a condition known as multiple endocrine adenomatosis.Cystic teratomas, or dermoid cysts, include endodermal, ectodermal, and mesodermal elements. They are characteristically cystic and contain poorly pigmented hair, sebaceous material, and occasionally teeth. Dermoid cysts occur in the gonads and central nervous system, as well as in the mediastinum. With rare exceptions, these lesions are benign.Thymomas are associated with myasthenia gravis, agammaglobulinemia, and red blood cell aplasia.

Cushing's reflex (Ref: Ganong 24\/e p607; Schwartz 9\/e p1521; Bailey 25\/e p483)The triad of hypertension, bradycardia and irregular respiration is seen in Cushing's reflex.'Elevated intracranial pressure, as caused by space occupying lesion like brain tumor or head trauma with associated intracranial bleeding (e.g. epidural \/subdural\/cerebral- haemorrhage), results in an increased systemic blood pressure (BP) and bradycardiaQ (rather than tachycardia) and irregular breathing. This response is called Cushing's reflex or phenomenon. 'Cushing's TriadIncrease in systolic blood pressureQ (Widening of pulse pressure)Reduction of the heart rateQ (bradycardia)Irregular respirationQ (caused by impaired brainstem function)Cushing ReflexCushing reflex (also referred to as the vasopressor response), is a physiological nervous system response to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) that results in Cushing's triad of increased blood pressure, irregular breathing, and a reduction of the heart rateQ.It is usually seen in the terminal stages of acute head injury and may indicate imminent brain herniationQ.These symptoms can be indicative of insufficient blood flow to the brain (ischemia) as well as compression of arteriolesQ.Etiology:It is a special CNS ischemic response that results from increased intracranial tension (or increased CSF pressure around the brain in cranial vault).Causes of increased ICT may be space occupying lesions such as brain tumorQ, cerebral abscess, head traumaQ with associated intra cranial bleeding (epidural\/ subdural\/ cerebral-haemorrhage)Pathophysiology:When the ICT or CSF pressure rises to equal the arterial pressure, it compresses the whole brain as well as the arteries in the brain and cuts off the blood supply to the brain, thereby activating the CNS ischemic responseCompromised blood supply, local hypoxia and hypercapnia of RVLM (rostral ventrolateral medulla) neurons or vasomotor area increase their discharge and evoke Cushing's reaction raising systemic arterial pressureQ.Cushing ReflexThe resultant rise in systemic arterial pressure (due to ischemic stimulation of vasomotor regions in medulla) tend to restore the blood flow to medulla, thereby protecting the vital centers of brain from loss of nutrition if ICT rises enough to compress cerebral arteries.The rise in BP is proportional to increase in intracranial tension (over a considerable range) and causes a reflex decrease in heart rate via the arterial baroreceptors. This is why bradycardia rather than tachycardia is characteristically seen in patients with increased intra cranial pressureQ.Bezotd-Jarisch reflex* In experimental animals, injections of serotonin, veratridine, capsaicin, phenyldiguanide. and some other drugs into the coronary arteries supplying the left ventricle cause apnea followed by rapid breathing, hypotension, and bradycardia (the coronary chemoreflex or Bezold-Jarisch reflex).* The receptors are probably C fiber endings, and the afferents are vagal.* The response is not produced by injections into the blood supply of the atria or the right ventricle.Hering-Bruer reflex* The Hering-Breuer inflation reflex is an increase in the duration of expiration produced by steady lung inflation, and the Hering-Breuer deflation reflex is a decrease in the duration of expiration produced by marked deflation of the lung.Bainbridge's reflex* Rapid infusion of blood or saline in anesthetized animals sometimes produces a rise in heart rate if the initial heart rate is low. This effect was described by Bainbridge in 1915, and since then it has been known as the Bainbridge reflex.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

Torsades usually occurs in bursts that are not sustained; thus, the rhythm strip usually shows the patient's baseline QT prolongation.The underlying basic for rhythm disturbance is delay in the phase 3 of action potential.The delay is mediated by sodium or potassium channels.The prolonged period of repolarization and the inhomogeneity of repolarization times among myocardial fibres allow dysrhythmia to emerge.","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Arrhythmias"}

Although its cause is unknown, Reiter syndrome is associated with HLA-B27 antigen, as are aortic regurgitation, pericarditis, and ankylosing spondylitis.Short stature, webbed neck, low-set ears, and epicanthal folds are the classic features of patients who have Turner syndrome. Persons affected by the syndrome, which is commonly linked with aortic coarctation, are genotypically XO. However, females and males have been described with normal sex chromosome constitutions (XX, XY) but with the phenotypic abnormalities of Turner syndrome. Additional cardiac lesions associated with Turner syndrome include septal defects, valvular stenosis, and anomalies of the great vessels.The Argyll Robertson pupil, a pupil that constricts with accommodation but not in response to light, is characteristic of central nervous system syphilis and is associated with vascular system manifestations of this disease. Treponema pallidum invades the vasa vasorum and causes an obliterative endarteritis and necrosis. The resulting aortitis gradually weakens the aortic wall and predisposes it to aneurysm formation. Once an aneurysm has formed, the prognosis is grave.Massive isolated tricuspid regurgitation produces a markedly elevated venous pressure, usually manifested by a severely engorged (often pulsating) liver. If the venous pressure is sufficiently elevated, exophthalmos may result. Tricuspid regurgitation of rheumatic origin is almost never an isolated lesion, and the major symptoms of patients who have rheumatic heart disease are usually attributable to concurrent left heart lesions. Bacterial endocarditis from intravenous drug abuse is becoming an increasingly important cause of isolated tricuspid regurgitation.A Quincke pulse, which consists of alternate flushing and paling of the skin or nail beds, is associated with aortic regurgitation. Other characteristic features of the peripheral pulse in aortic regurgitation include the water- hammer pulse (Corrigan pulse, caused by a rapid systolic upstroke) and pulsus bisferiens, which describes a double systolic hump in the pulse contour. The finding of a wide pulse pressure provides an additional diagnostic clue to aortic regurgitation.","subject_name":"Surgery","topic_name":"Heart & Pericardium"}

Compared with capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas are more infiltrative, frequently involve deep structures, and do not spontaneously regress. On histologic examination, the mass is sharply defined but unencapsulated and is composed of large, cavernous blood-filled vascular spaces, separated by connective tissue stroma. Intravascular thrombosis with associated dystrophic calcification is common. They may be locally destructive, so surgical excision may be required in some cases. More often the tumors are of little clinical significance, but they can be cosmetically troublesome and are vulnerable to traumatic ulceration and bleeding. Moreover, cavernous hemangiomas detected by imaging studies may be difficult to distinguish from their malignant counterpas. Brain hemangiomas also are problematic, as they can cause symptoms related to compression of adjacent tissue or rupture.Cavernous hemangiomas constitute one component of von Hippel-Lindau disease , in which vascular lesions are commonly found in the cerebellum, brain stem, retina, pancreas, and liver.

The radiation is typically toward the apex. The configuration is usually decrescendo and has a blowing character. The presence of this murmur is a good positive predictor for AR and the absence of this murmur strongly suggests the absence of AR. An Austin Flint murmur is usually associated with significant aortic regurgitation.Early diastolicPulmonaryregurgitationPulmonary regurgitation is most commonly due to pulmonaryhypertension (Graham-Steell murmur). It is a high-pitched and blowing murmur with a decrescendo configuration. It may increase in intensity during inspiration and best heard over left second and third intercostal spaces. The murmur usually does not extend to SI.Early diastolicLeft anterior descending artery stenosisThis murmur, also known as Dock s murmur, is similar to that of aortic regurgitation and is heard at the left second or third intercostal space. A Coronary artery bypass surgery can eliminate the murmur.Mid-diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionMid-diastolicMitral stenosisThe first heart sound (S,) is usually accentuated and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P,,) also is often accentuated, and the two components of the second heart sound (S,,) are closely split. The opening snap(OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05-0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent positionMid-diastolicTricuspid stenosisBest heard over the left sternal border with rumbling character and tricuspid opening snap with wide splitting SI. May increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallos sign). Tricuspid stenosis often occurs in association with mitral stenosis. Isolated TS are often associated with carcinoid disease and right atrial myxoma.Mid-diastolicAtrial myxomaAtrial myxomas are benign tumors of the heart. Left myxomas are far more common than right myxomas and those may cause obstruction of the mitral valve producing a mid-diastolic murmur similar to that of mitral stenosis. An echocardiographic evaluation is necessary.Mid-diastolicIncreased flow across the atrioventricular valveThis can also produce a mid-diastolic murmur, such as in severe mitral regurgitation where a large regurgitant volume in the left atrium can lead to \"functional mitral stenosis.\"Mid-diastolicAustin Flint murmurAn apical diastolic rumbling murmur in patients with pure aortic regurgitation. This can be mistaken with the murmur in mitral stenosis and should be noted by the fact that an Austin Flint murmur does not have an opening snap that is found in mitral stenosis.Mid-diastolicCarey-CoombsmurmurA mid-diastolic murmur over the left ventricular impulse due to mitral valvulitis from acute rheumatic fever.Late diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionLate diastolic (presystolic)Complete heart blockA short late diastolic murmur can occasionally be heard (Rytand's murmur).Mid-systolic ejectionTimeConditionDescriptionMid-systolicejectionAortic outflow obstruction (Aortic Stenosis)Can be due to aortic valve stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with a harsh and rough quality.**Valvular aortic stenosis can produce a harsh, or even a musical murmur over the right second intercostal space which radiates into the neck over the two carotid arteries. The most common cause of AS (Aortic Stenosis) is calcified valves due to aging. The second most common cause is congenital bicuspid aortic valves (normal valve is tricuspid). In aortic stenosis, heaving apical impulse is present. The distinguishing feature between these two causes is that bicuspid AS has little or no radiation. It can be confirmed if it also has an aortic ejection sound, a short early diastolic murmur, and normal carotid pulse. The murmur in valvular AS decreases with standing and straining with Valsalva maneuver.** Supravalvular aortic stenosis is loudest at a point slightly higher than in that of valvular AS and may radiate more to the right carotid artery **Subvalvular aortic stenosis is usually due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with murmur loudest over the left sternal border or the apex. The murmur in HCM increases in intensity with a standing position as well as straining with Valsalva maneuver.Mid-systolic ejectionPulmonic outflow obstruction (Pulmonary Stenosis)A harsh murmur usually on left second intercostal space radiating to left neck and accompanied by palpable thrill. It can be distinguished from a VSD (Ventricular septal defect) by listening to the S2, which is normal in VSD but it is widely split in pulmonary stenosis. However, VSD is almost always pansystolic where the murmur of pulmonary stenosis is diamond-shaped and ends clearly before S2. Many innocent murmurs also arise from this location but SI and S2 must split normally.Mid-systolicejectionDilation of aortic root or pulmonary arteryProduces an ejection sound, with a short ejection systolic murmur and a relatively wide split S2. There is no hemodynamic abnormality. This is similar to pulmonary hypertension except the latter has hemodynamic instabilities.Mid-systolicejectionIncreased semilunar blood flowThis can occur in situations such as anemia, pregnancy, or hyperthyroidism.Mid-systolicejectionAortic valve sclerosisThis is due to degenerative thickening of the roots of the aortic cusps but produces no obstruction and no hemodynamic instability and thus should be differentiated from aortic stenosis. It is heard over right second intercostal space writh a normal carotid pulse and normal S2.Mid-systolicejectionInnocent midsystolic murmursThese murmurs are not accompanied by other abnormal findings. One example of a benign paediatric heart murmur is Still's murmur in children.Late systolicTimeConditionDescription This is the most common cause of late systolic murmurs. It can be heard best over the apex of the heart, usually preceded by clicks. The most common cause of mitral valve prolapse is \"floppy\" valve (Barlow's) syndrome. If the prolapse becomes severe enough, mitral regurgitation may occur. Any maneuver that decreases leftLate systolicMitral valve prolapseventricular volume -- such as standing, sitting, Valsalva maneuver, and amyl nitrate inhalation -- can produce earlier onset of dicks, longer murmur duration, and decreased murmur intensity'. Any maneuver that increases left ventricular volume -- such as squatting, elevation of legs, hand grip, and phenylephrine -- can delay the onset of clicks, shorten murmur duration, and increase murmur intensity.Late systolicTricuspid valve prolapseUncommon without concomitant mitral valve prolapse. Best heard over left lowrer sternal border.Late systolicPapillary muscle dysfunctionUsually due to acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, which causes mild mitral regurgitation.Holosystolic (pansystolic)TimeConditionDescriptionHolosystolic(pansystolic)TricuspidinsufficiencyIntensifies upon inspiration. Can be best heard over the fourth left sternal border. The intensity can be accentuated following inspiration (Carvallo's sign) due to increased regurgitant floiv in right ventricular volume. Tricuspid regurgitation is most often secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Primary tricuspid regurgitation is less common and can be due to bacterial endocarditis following IV drug use, Ebstein s anomaly, carcinoid disease, or prior right ventricular infarction.Holosystolic(pansystolic)Mitral regurgitationThe S1 is generally absent, soft, or buried in the holosystolic murmur of chronic MR. In patients with severe MR, the aortic valve may close prematurely, resulting in wide but physiologic splitting of S2. A lowT-pitched S.. occurring 0.12-0.17 s after the aortic valve closure sound. It may be followed by a short, rumbling, middiastolic murmur, even in the absence of MS. A fourth heart sound is often audible in patients with acute severe MR who are in sinus rhythm. A presystolic murmur is not ordinarily heard with isolated MR. A systolic murmur of at least grade III\/VI intensity is the most characteristic auscultatory finding in chronic severe MR. It is usually holosystolic, but as previously noted it is decrescendo and ceases in mid- to late systole in patients with acute severe MR. The systolic murmur of chronic MR not due to MVP is intensified by isometric exercise (handgrip) but is reduced during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.Holosystolic (pan systolic)Ventricular septal defectNo intensification upon inspiration. VSD is a defect in the ventricular wall, producing a shunt between the left and right ventricles. Since the L ventricle has a higher pressure than the R ventricle, flow during systole occurs from the L to R ventricle, producing the holosystolic murmur. It can be best heard over the left third and fourth intercostal spaces and along the sternal border. It is associated with normal pulmonary artery pressure and thus S2 is normal. This fact can be used to distinguish from pulmonary stenosis, which has a wide splitting S2. When the shunt becomes reversed (\"Eisenmenger syndrome7'), the murmur may be absent and S2 can become markedly accentuated and single.

This phenomenon is characteristic of the murmur of AR. Murmurs of right-sided origin, such as tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, increase in intensity during inspiration. The intensity of left-sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration. Normal Physiologic Splitting Wkide physiologic splittingPhysiologic but wide splitting diving the respiratory cycle implies either premature aortic valve closure, as can occur with severe MR, or delayed pulmonic valve closure due to PS or right bundle branch block.Reversed splittingReversed splitting can be a feature of severe AS, HOCM, left bundle branch block, right ventricular apical pacing, or acute myocardial ischemia.Narrow physiologic splitting (|P2)Narrow physiologic splitting occurs in pulmonary hypertension, and both A2 and P2 are heard during expiration at a narrow splitting interval because of the increased intensity and high - frequency composition of P2Mild Vs Severe MSMild MSIn mild MS, the dtastoiic gradient across the valve is limited to the phases of rapid ventneutar filling in early diastole and presystole. The rumble may occur during either or both periods.In severe MS, a large pressure gradient exists across the valve during the entire diastolic filling, and the rumble persists throughout diastole. As the left atrial pressure becomes greater, the Interval between A2 [or P2) and the opening snap (O.S.) shortens. Secondary pulmonary hypertension develops and results In a loud P? and the splitting Interval usually narrows.ECGSevere MS","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Valvular Heart Disease"}

Several clues in this tracing suggest the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.* When ventricular tachycardia occurs, ventricular depolarization does not conduct through the normal His-Purkinje system but rather conducts slowly directly through ventricular myocardium. During some ventricular tachycardias, sinus node depolarization continues unabated, and most of the sinus impulses meet a refractory ventricle due to the dominant ectopic ventricular activity preventing conduction.","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Electrocardiography"}

It is caused by poor circulation of the blood to the affected area. The poor blood flow is often a result of atherosclerotic blockages more proximal to the affected area.Chronic Atherosclerotic Occlusive DiseaseAtherosclerosis may affect the thoracic and abdominal aorta.Occlusive aortic disease caused by atherosclerosis usually is confined to the distal abdominal aorta below the renal arteries.Frequently the disease extends to the iliac arteriesClaudication characteristically involves the buttocks, thighs, and calves and may be associated with impotence in males (Leriche syndrome).The severity of the symptoms depends on the adequacy of collaterals. With sufficient collateral blood flow, a complete occlusion of the abdominal aorta may occur without the development of ischemic symptoms.The physical findings include the absence of femoral and other distal pulses bilaterally and the detection of an audible bruit over the abdomen (usually at or below the umbilicus) and the common femoral arteries.Atrophic skin, loss of hair, and coolness of the lower extremities usually are observed.In advanced ischemia, rubor on dependency and pallor on elevation can be seen.Clinical Manifestations of Coarctation of the aortaIt is not usually associated with significant symptoms.Weakness or pain (or both) in the legs after exerciseHypertension on routine physical examination.Disparity in pulsation and blood pressure in the arms and legs (The classic sign of CO A)The femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak tor absent in up to 40% of patients), in contrast to the hounding pulses of the arms and carotid vessels.The radial and femoral pulses should always be palpated simultaneously for the presence of a radial-femoral delay.Normally, the femoral pulse occurs slightly before the radial pulse.A radial-femoral delay occurs when blood flow to the descending aorta is dependent on collaterals, in which case the femoral pulse is felt after the radial pulse.In normal persons (except neonates), systolic blood pressure in the legs obtained by the cuff method is 10-20 mm Hg higher than that in the arms.In coarctation of the aorta, blood pressure in the legs is lower than that in the armsThis differential in blood pressures is common in patients with coarctation who are older than 1 yrIt is important to determine the blood pressure in each armRight arm BP > Left arm BP: Left subclavian artery is involved in the area of coarctation.Left arm BP > Right arm BP: Right subclavian arises anomalously from below the area of coarctationWith exercise, a more prominent rise in systemic blood pressure occurs, and the upper-to-lower extremity pressure gradient will increase.The precordial impulse and heart sounds are usually normal.The presence of a systolic ejection click or thrill in the suprasternal notch suggests a bicuspid aortic valve (present in 70% of cases).A short systolic murmur is heard along the left sternal border at 3-4 ICS.In older patients with well-developed collateral blood flow, systolic or continuous murmurs maybe heard over the left and right sides of the chest laterally and posteriorly (SUZMAN's sign)A palpable thrill in the intercostal spaces on the back may be seen","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Diseases of the Aorta"}

Electrical signals travelling down this abnormal pathway (known as the bundle of Kent) may stimulate the ventricles to contract prematurely, resulting in a unique type of supraventricular tachycardia referred to as an atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia.The bundle of Kent is an abnormal extra or accessory conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles that is present in a small percentage (between 0.1% and 0.3%) of the general population. This pathway may communicate betrveen the left atrium and the left ventricle, in which case it is termed a \"type A pre-excitation\", or between the right atrium and the right ventricle, in which case it is termed a \"type B pre-excitation\". Problems arise when this pathway creates an electrical circuit that bypasses the AV node. The AV node is capable of slowing the rate of conduction of electrical impulses to the ventricles, whereas the bundle of Kent lacks this capability. When an aberrant electrical connection is made via the bundle of Kent, tachydysrhythmias may therefore result.WPW is commonly diagnosed on the basis of the electrocardiogram in an asymptomatic individual. In this case it is manifested as a delta wave, which is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is associated with a short PR interval. The short PR interval and slurring of the QRS complex is actually the impulse making it through to the ventricles prematurely (across the accessory pathway) wdthout the usual delay experienced in the AV node.","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Arrhythmias"}

Deep Venous Thrombosis andPulmonary ThromboembolismPULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM:PathophysiologyWhen venous thrombi dislodge from their site of formation, they embolize to the pulmonary arterial circulation or, paradoxically, to the arterial circulation through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. About half of patients with pelvic vein thrombosis or proximal leg DVT develop PE, which is usually asymptomatic.With increased use of chronic indwelling central venous catheters for hyperalimentation and chemotherapy, as well as more frequent insertion of permanent pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators, upper extremity venous thrombosis is becoming a more common problem. These thrombi rarely embolize and cause PE.Pathophysiological abnormalities include:The most common gas exchange abnormalities are hypoxemia (decreased arterial P02) and an increased alveolar-arterial 02 tension gradient, which represents the inefficiency of 02 transfer across the lungsIncreased pulmonary vascular resistance due to vascular obstruction or platelet secretion of vasoconstricting neurohumoral agents such as serotonin.Impaired gas exchange due to increased alveolar dead space from vascular obstruction, hypoxemia from alveolar hypoventilation relative to perfusion in the nonobstructed lung, right-to-left shunting, and impaired carbon monoxide transfer due to loss of gas exchange surface.Alveolar hyperventilation due to reflex stimulation of irritant receptorsIncreased airway resistance due to constriction of airways distal to the bronchiDecreased pulmonary compliance due to lung edema, lung hemorrhage, or loss of surfactantSigns & SymptomsSudden-onset dyspnea (shortness of breath)Tachypnea (rapid breathing)Chest pain of a \"pleuritic\" nature (worsened by breathing)Cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood).More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability due to decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the heart.Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct)A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is transudativeA low-grade fever may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarctionAbout 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PERisk factorsThe most common sources of embolism are proximal leg deep venous thrombosis (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses.The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named Virchows triad (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall and factors affecting the properties of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present.Alterations in blood flow: immobilization (after surgery, injury or long-distance air travel),pregnancy (also procoagulant), obesity (also procoagulant), cancer (also procoagulant)Factors in the vessel wall: of limited direct relevance in VTEFactors affecting the properties of the blood (procoagulant state)Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptionGenetic thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and plasminogen\/fibrinolysis disorders)Acquired thrombophilia (antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)Cancer (due to secretion of pro-coagulants)DiagnosisD-dimer is highly sensitive but not very specific (specificity around 50%), In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of certainty, an indication of absence of a PEThe gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) is pulmonary angiographyCT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using computed tomography (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right heart catheterization. Its advantages are clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to patientsVentilation\/perfusion scan (or V\/Q scan or lung scintigraphy), which shows that some areas of the lung are being ventilated but not perfused with blood (due to obstruction by a clot).

B. Total peripheral resistance. (Ref. Ganong 23rd\/pg. 80-81; Guyton 11th\/pg. 80)During exercise, sympathetic stimulation of the heart increases contractility; and thus stroke volume. A decrease in venous compliance, caused by sympathetic stimulation, increases venous return to the heart; which also increases stroke volume by a Frank-Starling mechanism. The increased stroke volume, coupled with an increase in heart rate, cause an increase in cardiac output Systemic arterial pressure also increases in response to the increase in cardiac output. However, the fall in total peripheral resistance, which is caused by dilation of the blood vessels within the exercising muscles, results in a decrease in diastolic pressure. The pulmonary vessels undergo passive dilation as more blood flows into the pulmonary circulation. As a result, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases.Additional Educational points:Isometric Versus Isotonic Contraction# Muscle contraction is said to be isometric when the muscle does not shorten during contraction and isotonic when it does shorten but the tension on the muscle remains constant throughout the contraction.# In the isometric system, the muscle contracts against a force transducer without decreasing the muscle length. In the isotonic system, the muscle shortens against a fixed load. The characteristics of isotonic contraction depend on the load against which the muscle contracts, as well as the inertia of the load. However, the isometric system records strictly changes in force of muscle contraction itself. Therefore, the isometric system is most often used when comparing the functional characteristics of different muscle types.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

Stimulation of b2 receptors cause vasodilation. Vasoconstriction (a1 receptors) predominate in skin, mucosal, renal andsphianchnic blood vessels. Dilatation (b2 receptors) predominate in skeletal muscles, liver and coronary blood vessels. The direct effect on cerebral vessels is not prominent - blood flow through this bed parallels change in BP. Renal vessels contain both a1 (vasoconstriction) and D1 (vasodilatiator) receptor.

Because current flows only in the body fluids, the records obtained are those that would be obtained if the electrodes were at the points of attachment of the limbs, no matter where on the limbs the electrodes are placed. In lead I, the electrodes are connected so that an upward deflection is inscribed when the left arm becomes positive relative to the right (left arm positive). In lead II, the electrodes are on the right arm and left leg, with the leg positive; and in lead III, the electrodes are on the left arm and left leg, with the leg positive. The P wave is produced by atrial depolarization, the QRS complex by ventricular depolarization, and the T wave by ventricular repolarization. The U wave is an inconstant finding, believed to be due to slow repolarization of the papillary muscles. The atria are located posteriorly in the chest. The ventricles from the base and anterior surface of the hea, and the right ventricle is anterolateral to the left. Thus, aVR \"looks at\" the cavities of the ventricles. Atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization move away from the exploring electrode, and the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave are therefore all negative (downward) deflections; aVL and aVF look at the ventricles, and the deflections are therefore predominantly positive or biphasic. There is no Q wave in V1 and V2 and the initial poion of the QRS complex is a small upward deflection because ventricular depolarization first moves across the midpoion of the septum from left to right toward the exploring electrode. The wave of excitation then moves down the septum and into the left ventricle away from the electrode, producing a large S wave. Finally, it moves back along the ventricular wall toward the electrode, producing the return to the isoelectric line. Conversely, in the left ventricular leads (V4-V6)there may be an initial small Q wave (left to right septal depolarization), and there is a large R wave (septal and left ventricular depolarization) followed in V4 and V5 by a moderate S wave (late depolarization of the ventricular walls moving back toward the AV junction). There is considerable variation in the position of the normal hea, and the position affects the configuration of the electrocardiographic complexes in the various leads.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO: 492,494","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Cardiovascular system"}

Three groups of CCBs include phenylalkylamines (verapamil, nor-verapamil), benzothiazepines (diltiazem) dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine, isradipine, lacidipine, felodipine and amlodipine). By inhibiting the calcium channels, these agents result in vasodilation and decreased activity of the hea (decrease hea rate, AV conduction and contractility). Dihydropyridine (DHP) group has little direct cardiac activity and acts mainly on blood vessels, therefore are also called peripherally acting CCBs. Verapamil and diltiazem have strong direct cardiodepressant (verapamil > diltiazem) activity. CCBs tend to cause reflex tachycardia (because of their vasodilatory action), which is nullified by the direct depressant action on the hea (except DHPs). Nicardipine is longest acting parenteral calcium channel blocker and is drug of choice for hypeensive emergencies. It is combined with beta blockers to avoid tachycardia. Nimodipine is a relatively cerebro-selective vasodilator, thus used to reverse the compensatory vasoconstriction after sub-arachnoid hemorrhage. Verapamil has maximum depressant action on the hea and it causes vasodilation by causing blockade of calcium channel. It is indicated for the treatment of angina, PSVT, hypeension and hyperophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Diltiazem has lesser effect on the hea than verapamil and is also indicated for these conditions. CCBs are especially suitable for elderly patients, patients with low renin hypeension, patients with diseases like asthma, migraine or peripheral vascular disease and in cases of isolated systolic hypeension. DHPs are safe in pregnancy. CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) should be avoided in conditions involving decreased conductivity of the hea like sick sinus syndrome, CHF and along with beta blockers (both cause myocardial depression). Clevidipine is an ultrasho acting DHP, recently approved for hypeensive emergencies.","subject_name":"Pharmacology","topic_name":"CHF, Angina Pectoris and Myocardial Infarction"}

The vasomotor centre is stimulated during inspiration by the irradiation of impulses from the inspiratory centres which causes rise in blood pressure.

Other disorders sometimes associated with hyperparathyroidism include peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and bone disease; central nervous system symptoms may also arise in connection with hyperparathyroidism. Occasionally, parathyroid adenomas occur in conjunction with neoplasms of other endocrine organs, a condition known as multiple endocrine adenomatosis.Cystic teratomas, or dermoid cysts, include endodermal, ectodermal, and mesodermal elements. They are characteristically cystic and contain poorly pigmented hair, sebaceous material, and occasionally teeth.

So there is overlap and also a short time iag between these two wave forms.This is very important to recognise as, even if the RA conduction is prolonged in pathology the RA component of P- wave still falls within the LA wave.Hence it is not shown in the ECG and P wave is not widened in RA enlargement.This is in contrast to LA enlargement, when the terminal half of P vector delayed it stretches the P wave wide beyond the normal 100ms. Hence LAE widens the P wave.P wave becomes taller in RA enlargemento In classical P pulmonale, the P wave is tall > 2.5 mm.o It is easy to explain why it not getting wide than why it is gettingtaller.The atrial vector has two components.The initial RA vector, is directed anteriorly. The main reason is due to the anatomical proximity of RA to the chest wall. Further the atrial electrical dp\/dt is fast, so the slope of forward limb is steep. Any R.4 voltage increase is easily picked up by the chest leads.LAE can not produce tall P waveo The left atrial vector which follows RA vector is mainly directed posteriorly and hence inscribe a descending limb ofP wave.o This causes the P terminal force.o So the direction of vector forces and the anatomical locality' make a tall and positive P deflection highly improbable in LAE.","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Electrocardiography"}

Transverse lines can be seen in the lateral one-third of the lower right lung zone. These are Kerley B lines and are indicative of interstitial pulmonary edema. There is straightening of the left hea border from the aoic shadow, called mitralization of the hea. The carinal angle appears to be about 90deg which is wider than normal, also suggesting an enlarged subcarinal left atrial appendage. This chest x-ray is consistent with pulmonary edema and left atrial and left ventricular enlargement. The CXR shows acute pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. Bilateral airspace densities are noted. Pulmonary edema is the result of increased pulmonary venous pressures, i.e., hydrostatic edema, which can be due to volume overload or congestive hea failure. This is usually associated with cardiomegaly, although the hea size may be normal in acute myocardial infarction or acute valvular dysfunction. Impaired pulmonary venous return due to left ventricular failure or mitral valve disease leads to increased pulmonary blood volume. Signs of cephalization of blood flow suggest enlargement of upper lobe pulmonary vessels. Mitral stenosis is one of the cardiac causes for elevated pulmonary venous pressure, although it has become relatively uncommon. The wellknown radiographic signs of pulmonary edema are cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and vascular congestion. Interstitial edema can be seen with blurring of the margins of blood vessels around the bronchial wall--called peribronchial cuffing--and in the subpleural position--called Kerley B lines. As capillary pressure rises, accumulated fluid in the interstitium adds to the interstitial pressure, forcing fluid into the alveolar space. Differentiation between pulmonary edema due to increased circular blood volume and that due to a failing left ventricle can be made on the basis of measurement of the vascular pedicle if the technique is not flawed. The radiographic differentiation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema from increased capillary permeability is also difficult. The criteria used are cardiac size, vascular distribution, and measurement of the vascular pedicle; this test has a predictive value of 75%. Some authors believe that the best sign of hydrostatic pulmonary edema is an abnormal right costophrenic angle containing Kerley B lines, subpleural edema, and pleural effusion. Those patients who have increased capillary permeability frequently have normal right costophrenic angles. The other most useful sign is the presence of an air bronchogram in increased capillary permeability edema and its absence in hydrostatic edema. The diagnosis of mitral stenosis is associated with a diastolic rumble on physical exam. The first hea sound is loud and there is no clubbing or koilonychia. Mitral stenosis may be complicated by atrial arrhythmias, hemoptysis secondary to left ventricular failure, or endocarditis. Atrial myxoma is not a complication but may mimic signs and symptoms of mitral stenosis. The radiographic sign suggestive of an atrial enlargement is a widened carinal angle.","subject_name":"Radiology","topic_name":"Cardiovascular system"}

When fully saturated, each gram of normal hemoglobin contains 1.39 mL of O2. However, blood normally contains small amounts of inactive hemoglobin derivatives, and the measured value in vivo is lower. The traditional figure is 1.34 mL of O2.# In vivo, the hemoglobin in the blood at the ends of the pulmonary capillaries is about 97.5% saturated with 02 (PO2 = 97 mm Hg). Because of a slight admixture with venous blood that bypasses the pulmonary capillaries (physiologic shunt), the hemoglobin in systemic arterial blood is only 97% saturated.# The arterial blood therefore contains a total of about 19.8 mL of 02 per dL: 0.29 mL in solution and 19.5 mL bound to hemoglobin. In venous blood at rest, the hemoglobin is 75% saturated and the total O2 content is about 15.2 mL\/dL: 0.12 mL in solution and 15.1 mL bound to hemoglobin.# About 250 mL of O2 per minute is transported from the blood to the tissues at rest.Also remember;GAS CONTENT OF BLOODmL\/dL of Blood Containing 15 g of HemoglobinArterial Blood (PO2 95 mm Hg;Venous blood (PO2 40 mm Hg;PCO2 40 mm Hg; Hb 97%PCO2 46 mm Hg; Hb 75%Saturated)Saturated) GasDissolvedCombinedDissolvedCombinedO20.2919.50.1215.1CO22.6246.42.9849.7N20.9800.980MYOGLOBIN# It is an iron-containing pigment found in skeletal muscle.# It resembles hemoglobin but binds 1 rather than 4 mol of O2 per mole.# Its dissociation curve is a rectangular hyperbola rather than a sigmoid curve.

Pain usually causes a rise in blood pressure via afferent impulses in the reticular formation converging in the RVLM.VASOMOTOR CONTROL# Spinal reflex activity affects blood pressure, but the main control of blood pressure is exerted by groups of neurons in the medulla oblongata that are sometimes called the vasomotor area \/ center.# Neurons that mediate increased sympathetic discharge to blood vessels and the heart project directly to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral gray column (IML) of the spinal cord.# On each side, the cell bodies of these neurons are located near the pial surface of the medulla in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). They contain PNMT, but it appears that the excitatory transmitter they secrete is glutamate rather than epinephrine.# When vasoconstrictor discharge increases, arteriolar constriction also increases and blood pressure rises.# Venoconstriction and a decrease in the stores of blood in the venous reservoirs usually accompany these changes, although changes in the capacitance vessels do not always parallel changes in the resistance vessels. Heart rate and stroke volume are increased because of activity in the sympathetic nerves to the heart, and cardiac output is increased.# Control of heart activity bx vasomotor center:# Lateral portions of vasomotor center transmit excitatory impulses through sympathetic fibers and increases heart rate and contractility.# Medial portion of vasomotor center- Lies in apposition to dorsal motor nuclei of vagus nerves- Transmits parasympathetic impulses through the vagus nerves to the heart to decrease heart rate.

It has two main phases : Ventricular systole and ventricular diastole.Ventricular systole tor simply systole)o The systolic phase is divided into : -Isovolumetric contraction : As the ventricular contraction starts, the intraventricular pressure begins to rise, leading to an abrupt closure of AV valves (mitral and tricuspid valves). The closure of AV valves produces first heart sound (S1). the pressure is not enough to push open the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) but causes the closed AV valve to bulge into the atrium, causing a small but sharp rise in atrial pressure called the 'C' wave on jugular venous pulse (JVP). Because both the valves (AV valves an semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i.e., there is isovolumetric (isometric) contraction. Isovolumetric contraction ends with opening of semilunar (aortic and pulmonary ) valves.Ventricular ejection : When the steeply rising ventricular pressure exceeds the pressure in aorta and pulmonary artery, the semilunar valves open and ventricular ejection begins. The ejection of blood is rapid at first (rapid ejection phase), but slows down during later part of systole (slow ejection phase). During rapid ejection phase, when the ventricles contract, the fibrous partition separating the ventricles from the atria (the AV ring) is pulled down. As a result, the atrial muscles get stretched and the atria dilate which causes a sharp fall in atrial pressure and the X-descent in JVP.Protodiastole : In this very short phase, ventricles start relaxing and ventricular pressure begins to fall very sharply but the semilunar valves are still open. As a result, the column of blood in aorta (or pulmonary artery for right ventricle) tries to fall into the ventricle, hitting on its way the semilunar (aortic or pulmonary) valves. This causes closure of the aortic\/pulmonary valves w hich produces 2nd heart sound (S2). The venous blood flow continues to flow in the atria from great veins (SVC and ICC) and there is relaxation of fibrous AV ring due to ventricular relaxation; both of which cause a rise in atrial pressure and production of 'V' wave in JVP.Ventricular diastole (or simply diastole)o The diastole phase is divided into : -Isovolumetric relaxation : - This phase is the period between the closure of semilunar valve and opening of the AV valve. The ventricles continue relaxing and there pressure continues to fall. However, as both valves (AV valves and semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i.e., isovolumetric relaxation. Relaxation phase ends w ith opening of AV valve.Rapid ventricular filling : - When the ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure, AV valves open and the accumulated blood in the atria rushes into the ventricle very rapidly. This passive filling contributes to 70% of ventricular filling, normally. This results in a sharp fall in atrial pressure which produces Y descent in JVP.Diastasis : - After the initial rapid ventricular filling, blood flow's slowly and smoothly from the SVC and IVC through the right atrium into the right ventricle without any turbulence anywhere along the path. Similarly, blood from the pulmonary' veins flows into the left ventricle without any turbulence. This phase of nonturbulent ventricular filling is called diastasis. The atrial pressure remains slightly greater than the ventricular pressure because inflow' to atrium exceeds the outflow the atrium.Last rapid filling phase (atrial systole) : - The atria contract and pump blood rapidly into the ventricles.Atrial systole is associated with sharp rise in atrial pressure which produces a-wave in JVP.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

These changes produce hypercontractility that predisposes patients to the risk of sudden death. There is an increased incidence of hyperophic cardiomyopathy within families, and there is evidence that it may be an autosomal dominant disorder. The disease is thought to result from a mutation in the cardiac b-myosin heavy chain gene. Patients may experience dyspnea, lightheadedness, and chest pain, especially upon physical exeion; however, many patients appear to be asymptomatic, although sudden, unexpected death occurs not infrequently, especially following or during physical exeion. This risk is increased with factors that either increase the contractility of the hea or decrease the volume of the left ventricle (both of which increase the left ventricular outflow obstruction). T reatment for patients with hyperophic cardiomyopathy, therefore, is with drugs that decrease contractility. Examples of these types of drugs include b-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers. In individuals with hyperophic cardiomyopathy, agents that increase contractility are contraindicated. Examples of these types of drugs include glycosides, such as digitalis. Epinephrine and b-adrenergic agonists, which increase cardiac output by increasing stroke volume and hea rate, would also be contraindicated. Diuretics would also be dangerous, as they would decrease intravascular volume, and this would accentuate the bad effects of the septal hyperophy because of the decreased left ventricular volume. dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy results in a flabby, hypocontractile hea. Constrictive (restrictive) cardiomyopathy is associated in the United States with amyloidosis and endocardial fibroelastosis. It is so named because of the infiltration and deposition of material in the endomyocardium and the layering of collagen and elastin over the endocardium. This deposition affects the ability of the ventricles to accommodate blood volume during diastole.

The fluid is usually clear but may be blood-stained. In the long term, lymphangiomas thrombose and fibrose, forming hard nodules that may raise concerns about malignancy. If lymphangiomas are <5cm across, they are termed lymphangioma circumscriptum, and if they are more widespread, they are termed lymphangioma diffusum. If they form a reticulate pattern of ridges then it has been termed lymphoedema ab igne. Lymphangiomas frequently weep (lymphorrhoea, chylorrhoea), causing skin maceration, and they act as a poal for infection. Protein-losing diarrhoea, chylous ascites, chylothorax, chyluria and discharge from lymphangiomas suggest lymphangectasia (megalymphatics) and chylous reflux. Ulceration, non-healing bruises and raised purple-red nodules should lead to suspicion of malignancy. Lymphangiosarcoma was originally described in postmastectomy oedema (Stewa-Treves' syndrome) and affects around 0.5% of patients at a mean onset of 10 years. However, lymphangiosarcoma can develop in any long-standing lymphoedema, but usually takes longer to manifest (20 years). It presents as single or multiple bluish\/red skin and subcutaneous nodules that spread to form satellite lesions, which may then become confluent. Thediagnosis is usually made late and confirmed by excision biopsy. Amputation offers the best chance of survival but, even then, most patients live for less than 3 years. It has been suggested that lymphoedema leads to an impairment of immune surveillance and so predisposes to other malignancies, although the causal association is not as definite as it is for lymphangiosarcoma.

During stress the blood flow to an area is increased upto five times above the resting condition. But in the case of coronary artery stenosis the blood supply to the area supplied by the stenosed artery will not increase proportionately so the isotope uptake will be low and an area of hypoperfusion appear.In case of thallium what happens is that over the next several hours a complex process occurs that is known as redistribution'. Due to this process thallium continues to pour in the hypoperfused area and the final result is that an area which initially appeared as an area of reduced uptake becomes apparently normal over time.Note - In region of fibrosis (infarction or dead tissue) there will be no redistribution on delayed imaging.","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"M.I. & Angina"}

The radiation is typically toward the apex. The configuration is usually decrescendo and has a blowing character. The presence of this murmur is a good positive predictor for AR and the absence of this murmur strongly suggests the absence of AR. An Austin Flint murmur is usually associated with significant aortic regurgitation.Early diastolicPulmonaryregurgitationPulmonary regurgitation is most commonly due to pulmonaryhypertension (Graham-Steell murmur). It is a high-pitched and blowing murmur with a decrescendo configuration. It may increase in intensity during inspiration and best heard over left second and third intercostal spaces. The murmur usually does not extend to SI.Early diastolicLeft anterior descending artery stenosisThis murmur, also known as Dock s murmur, is similar to that of aortic regurgitation and is heard at the left second or third intercostal space. A Coronary artery bypass surgery can eliminate the murmur.Mid-diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionMid-diastolicMitral stenosisThe first heart sound (S,) is usually accentuated and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P,,) also is often accentuated, and the two components of the second heart sound (S,,) are closely split. The opening snap(OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05-0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent positionMid-diastolicTricuspid stenosisBest heard over the left sternal border with rumbling character and tricuspid opening snap with wide splitting SI. May increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallos sign). Tricuspid stenosis often occurs in association with mitral stenosis. Isolated TS are often associated with carcinoid disease and right atrial myxoma.Mid-diastolicAtrial myxomaAtrial myxomas are benign tumors of the heart. Left myxomas are far more common than right myxomas and those may cause obstruction of the mitral valve producing a mid-diastolic murmur similar to that of mitral stenosis. An echocardiographic evaluation is necessary.Mid-diastolicIncreased flow across the atrioventricular valveThis can also produce a mid-diastolic murmur, such as in severe mitral regurgitation where a large regurgitant volume in the left atrium can lead to \"functional mitral stenosis.\"Mid-diastolicAustin Flint murmurAn apical diastolic rumbling murmur in patients with pure aortic regurgitation. This can be mistaken with the murmur in mitral stenosis and should be noted by the fact that an Austin Flint murmur does not have an opening snap that is found in mitral stenosis.Mid-diastolicCarey-CoombsmurmurA mid-diastolic murmur over the left ventricular impulse due to mitral valvulitis from acute rheumatic fever.Late diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionLate diastolic (presystolic)Complete heart blockA short late diastolic murmur can occasionally be heard (Rytand's murmur).Mid-systolic ejectionTimeConditionDescriptionMid-systolicejectionAortic outflow obstruction (Aortic Stenosis)Can be due to aortic valve stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with a harsh and rough quality.**Valvular aortic stenosis can produce a harsh, or even a musical murmur over the right second intercostal space which radiates into the neck over the two carotid arteries. The most common cause of AS (Aortic Stenosis) is calcified valves due to aging. The second most common cause is congenital bicuspid aortic valves (normal valve is tricuspid). In aortic stenosis, heaving apical impulse is present. The distinguishing feature between these two causes is that bicuspid AS has little or no radiation. It can be confirmed if it also has an aortic ejection sound, a short early diastolic murmur, and normal carotid pulse. The murmur in valvular AS decreases with standing and straining with Valsalva maneuver.** Supravalvular aortic stenosis is loudest at a point slightly higher than in that of valvular AS and may radiate more to the right carotid artery **Subvalvular aortic stenosis is usually due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with murmur loudest over the left sternal border or the apex. The murmur in HCM increases in intensity with a standing position as well as straining with Valsalva maneuver.Mid-systolic ejectionPulmonic outflow obstruction (Pulmonary Stenosis)A harsh murmur usually on left second intercostal space radiating to left neck and accompanied by palpable thrill. It can be distinguished from a VSD (Ventricular septal defect) by listening to the S2, which is normal in VSD but it is widely split in pulmonary stenosis. However, VSD is almost always pansystolic where the murmur of pulmonary stenosis is diamond-shaped and ends clearly before S2. Many innocent murmurs also arise from this location but SI and S2 must split normally.Mid-systolicejectionDilation of aortic root or pulmonary arteryProduces an ejection sound, with a short ejection systolic murmur and a relatively wide split S2. There is no hemodynamic abnormality. This is similar to pulmonary hypertension except the latter has hemodynamic instabilities.Mid-systolicejectionIncreased semilunar blood flowThis can occur in situations such as anemia, pregnancy, or hyperthyroidism.Mid-systolicejectionAortic valve sclerosisThis is due to degenerative thickening of the roots of the aortic cusps but produces no obstruction and no hemodynamic instability and thus should be differentiated from aortic stenosis. It is heard over right second intercostal space writh a normal carotid pulse and normal S2.Mid-systolicejectionInnocent midsystolic murmursThese murmurs are not accompanied by other abnormal findings. One example of a benign paediatric heart murmur is Still's murmur in children.Late systolicTimeConditionDescription This is the most common cause of late systolic murmurs. It can be heard best over the apex of the heart, usually preceded by clicks. The most common cause of mitral valve prolapse is \"floppy\" valve (Barlow's) syndrome. If the prolapse becomes severe enough, mitral regurgitation may occur. Any maneuver that decreases leftLate systolicMitral valve prolapseventricular volume -- such as standing, sitting, Valsalva maneuver, and amyl nitrate inhalation -- can produce earlier onset of dicks, longer murmur duration, and decreased murmur intensity'. Any maneuver that increases left ventricular volume -- such as squatting, elevation of legs, hand grip, and phenylephrine -- can delay the onset of clicks, shorten murmur duration, and increase murmur intensity.Late systolicTricuspid valve prolapseUncommon without concomitant mitral valve prolapse. Best heard over left lowrer sternal border.Late systolicPapillary muscle dysfunctionUsually due to acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, which causes mild mitral regurgitation.Holosystolic (pansystolic)TimeConditionDescriptionHolosystolic(pansystolic)TricuspidinsufficiencyIntensifies upon inspiration. Can be best heard over the fourth left sternal border. The intensity can be accentuated following inspiration (Carvallo's sign) due to increased regurgitant floiv in right ventricular volume. Tricuspid regurgitation is most often secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Primary tricuspid regurgitation is less common and can be due to bacterial endocarditis following IV drug use, Ebstein s anomaly, carcinoid disease, or prior right ventricular infarction.Holosystolic(pansystolic)Mitral regurgitationThe S1 is generally absent, soft, or buried in the holosystolic murmur of chronic MR. In patients with severe MR, the aortic valve may close prematurely, resulting in wide but physiologic splitting of S2. A lowT-pitched S.. occurring 0.12-0.17 s after the aortic valve closure sound. It may be followed by a short, rumbling, middiastolic murmur, even in the absence of MS. A fourth heart sound is often audible in patients with acute severe MR who are in sinus rhythm. A presystolic murmur is not ordinarily heard with isolated MR. A systolic murmur of at least grade III\/VI intensity is the most characteristic auscultatory finding in chronic severe MR. It is usually holosystolic, but as previously noted it is decrescendo and ceases in mid- to late systole in patients with acute severe MR. The systolic murmur of chronic MR not due to MVP is intensified by isometric exercise (handgrip) but is reduced during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.Holosystolic (pan systolic)Ventricular septal defectNo intensification upon inspiration. VSD is a defect in the ventricular wall, producing a shunt between the left and right ventricles. Since the L ventricle has a higher pressure than the R ventricle, flow during systole occurs from the L to R ventricle, producing the holosystolic murmur. It can be best heard over the left third and fourth intercostal spaces and along the sternal border. It is associated with normal pulmonary artery pressure and thus S2 is normal. This fact can be used to distinguish from pulmonary stenosis, which has a wide splitting S2. When the shunt becomes reversed (\"Eisenmenger syndrome7'), the murmur may be absent and S2 can become markedly accentuated and single.

This phenomenon is characteristic of the murmur of AR. Murmurs of right-sided origin, such as tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, increase in intensity during inspiration. The intensity of left-sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration. Normal Physiologic Splitting Wkide physiologic splittingPhysiologic but wide splitting diving the respiratory cycle implies either premature aortic valve closure, as can occur with severe MR, or delayed pulmonic valve closure due to PS or right bundle branch block.Reversed splittingReversed splitting can be a feature of severe AS, HOCM, left bundle branch block, right ventricular apical pacing, or acute myocardial ischemia.Narrow physiologic splitting (|P2)Narrow physiologic splitting occurs in pulmonary hypertension, and both A2 and P2 are heard during expiration at a narrow splitting interval because of the increased intensity and high - frequency composition of P2Mild Vs Severe MSMild MSIn mild MS, the dtastoiic gradient across the valve is limited to the phases of rapid ventneutar filling in early diastole and presystole. The rumble may occur during either or both periods.In severe MS, a large pressure gradient exists across the valve during the entire diastolic filling, and the rumble persists throughout diastole. As the left atrial pressure becomes greater, the Interval between A2 [or P2) and the opening snap (O.S.) shortens. Secondary pulmonary hypertension develops and results In a loud P? and the splitting Interval usually narrows.ECGSevere MS","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Valvular Heart Disease"}

V. volume during pregnancy is the presence of grade 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur.This physiologic murmur appears at about 10-12 weeks into the pregnancy and disappears in the beginning of the postpartum period.The increase in the intravascular volume fulfills the needs of the developing uteroplacental circulation and protects the mother against the potentially harmful effects of the blood loss that occurs at parturition.The increase in blood volume of pregnancy does not alter the central venous pressure (CVP), which is the same as in the nonpregnant women.Another important hemodynamic change in pregnancy is decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR).PVR decreases during pregnancy on the arterial side and the venous side of the circulation. The cause of this change is not well understood, but is most likely a direct effect of placental hormones or vasodilator prostaglandins (prostacyclins) on blood vessels.The decreased peripheral vascular resistance is manifested clinically by a decrease in both mean and diastolic blood pressure. This decrease is clearly observed during second trimester.Because most of the intravascular volume is contained in the capacitance vessels, the decrease in venous resistance represents the adaptation of the vascular tree to the blood volume expansion. If this adaptation does not occur, thev. volume will not expand, thereby seriously compromising the uteroplacental circulation.Hemodynamic changes in normal pregnancy*Cardiac output- Increased*Heart rate- Increased*Systemic vascular resistance- Increased*Pulmonary vascular resistance- Increased*Mean arterial pressure- Increased*Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure- Increased*Central venous pressure- Normal*Left ventricular stroke volume- IncreasedAlso knowThere are several periods during pregnancy when the danger of cardiac decompensation is especially great.First is between 12 and 32 weeks of gestation, a time during which hemodynamic changes of pregnancy develops.The most critical period is between 28-32 weeks of gestation, when the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy peak and cardiac demands are maximum.The other dangerous time for pregnant cardiac patient is during labour and delivery.During labour every uterine contractions injects blood from the uteroplacental circulation into the maternal blood stream increasing the cardiac output by approximately 15% to 20%.This continuous demand on the heart may trigger congestive heart failure,During the second stage of labour, maternal pushing further compromises the venous return to the heart causing a decrease in cardiac output that may be critical for some cardiac patients.The final dangerous time for the pregnant cardiac patient is 4-5 days after delivery.Patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome, Aortic stenosis and cyanotic heart disease may be able to go through pregnancy and labour and delivery without major complications.However, sudden death in the early postpartum period may occur. Decreased peripheral resistance with right to left shunting and pulmonary embolization from silent iliofemoral thrombus are two problems occurring at this time.","subject_name":"Gynaecology & Obstetrics","topic_name":"Cardiovascular System"}

There is a linear hyperlucent margin along the left cardiac border, suggesting an air-soft tissue interface. This is seen in pneumopericardium. The chest x-ray shows a pneumopericardium. This refers to the presence of air within the pericardial sac. Pathologically, air can enter the pericardium from the mediastinum near the pulmonary veins. Air can also develop within the pericardium due to production by gas-forming organisms in cases of infection. At times the pneumopericardium may be complicated by the presence of fluid (hydropneumopericardium) or pus (pyopneumopericardium). Closed chest injury with or without perforation of the pericardium is the most frequent nonsurgical cause associated with this kind of pattern. Contiguous organ involvement (pulmonary abscess, bronchogenic carcinoma, esophagitis, perforated gastric ulcer, foreign body) also can result in the involvement of the pericardium and hence cause pneumopericardium. Septicemia causing direct seeding of the pericardial space can also produce a common communication with the lung. With pneumopericardium, the lucent halo of air paially or completely surrounds the hea but does not extend superiorly to the attachments of the pericardium, and the concomitant subcutaneous emphysema is absent. If supine and erect radiographs are obtained, pericardial air will immediately shift in location whereas mediastinal air change will not occur.The \"continuous diaphragm sign\" is seen in pneumomediastinum.

The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position. APPENDIX- 79HEART MURMURSREF: Harrison 18th ed chapter 8Early diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionEarly diastolicAortic regurgitationThe murmur is low intensity, high-pitched, best heard over the left sternal border or over the right second intercostal space, especially if the patient leans forward and holds breath in full expiration. The radiation is typically toward the apex. The configuration is usually decrescendo and has a blowing character. The presence of this murmur is a good positive predictor for AR and the absence of this murmur strongly suggests the absence of AR. An Austin Flint murmur is usually associated with significant aortic regurgitation.Early diastolicPulmonaryregurgitationPulmonary regurgitation is most commonly due to pulmonaryhypertension (Graham-Steell murmur). It is a high-pitched and blowing murmur with a decrescendo configuration. It may increase in intensity during inspiration and best heard over left second and third intercostal spaces. The murmur usually does not extend to SI.Early diastolicLeft anterior descending artery stenosisThis murmur, also known as Dock s murmur, is similar to that of aortic regurgitation and is heard at the left second or third intercostal space. A Coronary artery bypass surgery can eliminate the murmur.Mid-diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionMid-diastolicMitral stenosisThe first heart sound (S,) is usually accentuated and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P,,) also is often accentuated, and the two components of the second heart sound (S,,) are closely split. The opening snap(OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05-0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent positionMid-diastolicTricuspid stenosisBest heard over the left sternal border with rumbling character and tricuspid opening snap with wide splitting SI. May increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallos sign). Tricuspid stenosis often occurs in association with mitral stenosis. Isolated TS are often associated with carcinoid disease and right atrial myxoma.Mid-diastolicAtrial myxomaAtrial myxomas are benign tumors of the heart. Left myxomas are far more common than right myxomas and those may cause obstruction of the mitral valve producing a mid-diastolic murmur similar to that of mitral stenosis. An echocardiographic evaluation is necessary.Mid-diastolicIncreased flow across the atrioventricular valveThis can also produce a mid-diastolic murmur, such as in severe mitral regurgitation where a large regurgitant volume in the left atrium can lead to \"functional mitral stenosis.\"Mid-diastolicAustin Flint murmurAn apical diastolic rumbling murmur in patients with pure aortic regurgitation. This can be mistaken with the murmur in mitral stenosis and should be noted by the fact that an Austin Flint murmur does not have an opening snap that is found in mitral stenosis.Mid-diastolicCarey-CoombsmurmurA mid-diastolic murmur over the left ventricular impulse due to mitral valvulitis from acute rheumatic fever.Late diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionLate diastolic (presystolic)Complete heart blockA short late diastolic murmur can occasionally be heard (Rytand's murmur).Mid-systolic ejectionTimeConditionDescriptionMid-systolicejectionAortic outflow obstruction (Aortic Stenosis)Can be due to aortic valve stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with a harsh and rough quality.**Valvular aortic stenosis can produce a harsh, or even a musical murmur over the right second intercostal space which radiates into the neck over the two carotid arteries. The most common cause of AS (Aortic Stenosis) is calcified valves due to aging. The second most common cause is congenital bicuspid aortic valves (normal valve is tricuspid). In aortic stenosis, heaving apical impulse is present. The distinguishing feature between these two causes is that bicuspid AS has little or no radiation. It can be confirmed if it also has an aortic ejection sound, a short early diastolic murmur, and normal carotid pulse. The murmur in valvular AS decreases with standing and straining with Valsalva maneuver.** Supravalvular aortic stenosis is loudest at a point slightly higher than in that of valvular AS and may radiate more to the right carotid artery **Subvalvular aortic stenosis is usually due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with murmur loudest over the left sternal border or the apex. The murmur in HCM increases in intensity with a standing position as well as straining with Valsalva maneuver.Mid-systolic ejectionPulmonic outflow obstruction (Pulmonary Stenosis)A harsh murmur usually on left second intercostal space radiating to left neck and accompanied by palpable thrill. It can be distinguished from a VSD (Ventricular septal defect) by listening to the S2, which is normal in VSD but it is widely split in pulmonary stenosis. However, VSD is almost always pansystolic where the murmur of pulmonary stenosis is diamond-shaped and ends clearly before S2. Many innocent murmurs also arise from this location but SI and S2 must split normally.Mid-systolicejectionDilation of aortic root or pulmonary arteryProduces an ejection sound, with a short ejection systolic murmur and a relatively wide split S2. There is no hemodynamic abnormality. This is similar to pulmonary hypertension except the latter has hemodynamic instabilities.Mid-systolicejectionIncreased semilunar blood flowThis can occur in situations such as anemia, pregnancy, or hyperthyroidism.Mid-systolicejectionAortic valve sclerosisThis is due to degenerative thickening of the roots of the aortic cusps but produces no obstruction and no hemodynamic instability and thus should be differentiated from aortic stenosis. It is heard over right second intercostal space writh a normal carotid pulse and normal S2.Mid-systolicejectionInnocent midsystolic murmursThese murmurs are not accompanied by other abnormal findings. One example of a benign paediatric heart murmur is Still's murmur in children.Late systolicTimeConditionDescription This is the most common cause of late systolic murmurs. It can be heard best over the apex of the heart, usually preceded by clicks. The most common cause of mitral valve prolapse is \"floppy\" valve (Barlow's) syndrome. If the prolapse becomes severe enough, mitral regurgitation may occur. Any maneuver that decreases leftLate systolicMitral valve prolapseventricular volume -- such as standing, sitting, Valsalva maneuver, and amyl nitrate inhalation -- can produce earlier onset of dicks, longer murmur duration, and decreased murmur intensity'. Any maneuver that increases left ventricular volume -- such as squatting, elevation of legs, hand grip, and phenylephrine -- can delay the onset of clicks, shorten murmur duration, and increase murmur intensity.Late systolicTricuspid valve prolapseUncommon without concomitant mitral valve prolapse. Best heard over left lowrer sternal border.Late systolicPapillary muscle dysfunctionUsually due to acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, which causes mild mitral regurgitation.Holosystolic (pansystolic)TimeConditionDescriptionHolosystolic(pansystolic)TricuspidinsufficiencyIntensifies upon inspiration. Can be best heard over the fourth left sternal border. The intensity can be accentuated following inspiration (Carvallo's sign) due to increased regurgitant floiv in right ventricular volume. Tricuspid regurgitation is most often secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Primary tricuspid regurgitation is less common and can be due to bacterial endocarditis following IV drug use, Ebstein s anomaly, carcinoid disease, or prior right ventricular infarction.Holosystolic(pansystolic)Mitral regurgitationThe S1 is generally absent, soft, or buried in the holosystolic murmur of chronic MR. In patients with severe MR, the aortic valve may close prematurely, resulting in wide but physiologic splitting of S2. A lowT-pitched S.. occurring 0.12-0.17 s after the aortic valve closure sound. It may be followed by a short, rumbling, middiastolic murmur, even in the absence of MS. A fourth heart sound is often audible in patients with acute severe MR who are in sinus rhythm. A presystolic murmur is not ordinarily heard with isolated MR. A systolic murmur of at least grade III\/VI intensity is the most characteristic auscultatory finding in chronic severe MR. It is usually holosystolic, but as previously noted it is decrescendo and ceases in mid- to late systole in patients with acute severe MR. The systolic murmur of chronic MR not due to MVP is intensified by isometric exercise (handgrip) but is reduced during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.Holosystolic (pan systolic)Ventricular septal defectNo intensification upon inspiration. VSD is a defect in the ventricular wall, producing a shunt between the left and right ventricles. Since the L ventricle has a higher pressure than the R ventricle, flow during systole occurs from the L to R ventricle, producing the holosystolic murmur. It can be best heard over the left third and fourth intercostal spaces and along the sternal border. It is associated with normal pulmonary artery pressure and thus S2 is normal. This fact can be used to distinguish from pulmonary stenosis, which has a wide splitting S2. When the shunt becomes reversed (\"Eisenmenger syndrome7'), the murmur may be absent and S2 can become markedly accentuated and single.

This phenomenon is characteristic of the murmur of AR. Murmurs of right-sided origin, such as tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, increase in intensity during inspiration. The intensity of left-sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration. Normal Physiologic Splitting Wkide physiologic splittingPhysiologic but wide splitting diving the respiratory cycle implies either premature aortic valve closure, as can occur with severe MR, or delayed pulmonic valve closure due to PS or right bundle branch block.Reversed splittingReversed splitting can be a feature of severe AS, HOCM, left bundle branch block, right ventricular apical pacing, or acute myocardial ischemia.Narrow physiologic splitting (|P2)Narrow physiologic splitting occurs in pulmonary hypertension, and both A2 and P2 are heard during expiration at a narrow splitting interval because of the increased intensity and high - frequency composition of P2Mild Vs Severe MSMild MSIn mild MS, the dtastoiic gradient across the valve is limited to the phases of rapid ventneutar filling in early diastole and presystole. The rumble may occur during either or both periods.In severe MS, a large pressure gradient exists across the valve during the entire diastolic filling, and the rumble persists throughout diastole. As the left atrial pressure becomes greater, the Interval between A2 [or P2) and the opening snap (O.S.) shortens. Secondary pulmonary hypertension develops and results In a loud P? and the splitting Interval usually narrows.","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Valvular Heart Disease"}

Otherwise only correct answer is calcium. Thrombosthenin is involved in clot retraction.Platelet-associated factor XIII provides a means by which to promote clot stabilization and platelet interaction with proteins of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways.Fibrin stabilising factor (factor XIII) which is normally present in the plasma and also released from activated platelets is activated by thrombin to form XIIla but the XIIIa in the prescence of Ca2+ causes formation of covalent crosslinkages between fibrin threads, thus adding tremendous strength to the fibrin meshwork. The fibrin meshwork traps the remaining components of plasma and blood cells to form a solid mass called clotThrombomodulin is a thrombin binding protein produced by all endothelial cells except those in cerebral microcirculation.lt converts thrombin into protein C activator (AIPGME2007)Thrombasthenin is a contractile protein present in platelet involved in clot retraction and not in stabilizationActivated factor XIII will bind to the surface of activated platelets. These platelets then participate in cell-cell or cell-clot interactions, thereby increasing the local concentration of factor XIIIa.The platelet-associated factor Xllla may increase the amount of crosslinking in a fibrin clot, thereby contributing to the aging of the clot and the reduction in the degree of platelet binding. Clot resistance to fibrinolysis is enhanced by platelet factor XEIIa-mediated crosslinking of alpha 2-antiplasmin to fibrin. The binding of factor XIIIa to the platelet surface requires the activation of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein Ilb-IIIa.Thus, platelet-associated factor Xllla may be used as a marker of in vivo platelet activation. Since half of the factor XIII present in blood is provided by the platelets, it is not surprising that this form of factor XIII plays an important role in hemostasis.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

Among patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are already being treated with such a three drug regimen at maximum recommended and tolerated doses, spironolactone is added.o Most patients with resistant hypertension are being treated with a three-drug regimen different from ihe preferred regimen of an angiotensin inhibitor, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and diuretic chlorthalidone; in addition, most who are prescribed four or more antihypertensive drags are not receiving an aldosterone antagonist.Diureticso Persistent volume expansion (typically not sufficient to produce edema) contributes to resistant hypertension, even among patients who have been on conventional doses of thiazide diuretics,o Effective diuretic use is almost always necessary to achieve blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension.o Diuretics should be titrated until the blood pressure goal or the maximum recommended dose (as described below) has been reached or the patient has signs suggestive of overdiuresis such as fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, or decreased tissue perfusion as evidenced by an otherwise unexplained elevation in ihe serumcreatinine concentration. If overdiuresis is suspected, diuretic therapy needs to be reduced.o In those with little renal impairment, chlorthalidone is preferred to hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of resistant hypertension.Aldosterone antagonistso The available aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone, are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, while potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, amiloride and triamterene) block collecting tubule sodium channels that are normally opened by aldosterone.

They are attached to various parts of the ventricular aspects or the free margins of the cusps. They have been classified into first-, second-and third-order chordae according to the distance of the attachment from the margins of the cusps.Fan-shaped chordae have a short stem from which branches radiate to attach to the margins (or the ventricular aspect) of the zones of apposition between cusps and to the ends of adjacent cusps. Rough zone chordae arise from a single stem which usually splits into three components that attach to the free margin.True chordae of the mitral valve may be divided into intercusp (or commissural) chordae, rough zone chordae, including the special strut chordae, so-called 'cleft' chordae and basal chordae. Most true chordae divide into branches from a single stem soon after their origin from the apical one-third of a papillary muscle, or proceed as single chordae that divide into several branches near their attachment.

C. Verteral Osteochondritis. (Ref. Fundamentals of Pediatric Orthopedics \/pg. 17).Scheuermann's disease refers to osteochondrosis of the secondary ossification centers of the vertebral bodies. The lower dorsal and upper lumbar vertebrae are involved initially. The process may be limited to several bodies or may involve the entire dorsal and lumbar spine.Osteochondritis of the upper and lower cartilaginous vertebral plates has been incriminated in the development of Scheuermann's disease. A definite hereditary component is involved in the development of the condition, but the mode of inheritance has been debated.Patients with Scheuermann's disease generally are affected at age 13-16 years,Scheuermann's disease affects boys more frequently than it does girls.Sorenson suggested the following radiologic criteria for the diagnosis of Scheuermann's disease:# Hyperkyphosis greater than 40deg# Irregular upper and lower vertebral endplates with loss of disk space height# Wedging of 5deg or more in 3 consecutive vertebraeLateral radiograph of the spine demonstrates diagnostic changes in Scheuermann's disease.# Wedge-shaped vertebral bodies# Arcuate and rigid kyphosis# Narrow intervertebral disk spaces with calcifications# Prominent irregularities of the vertebral surfaces# Vertebral plates that are poorly formed and that develop multiple herniations of the nucleus pulposus known as Schmorl nodes (Note that Schmorl nodes are not uncommon and may be seen in Wilson disease, sickle cell anemia, and spinal stenosis.)# Patients with mild, nonprogressive disease can be treated by reducing weight-bearing stress and avoiding strenuous activity. Exercise alone is not found to be beneficial.# When the kyphosis is more severe, recommendations include casting, a spinal brace, or rest and recumbency on a rigid bed. Orthotic management of Scheuermann's disease usually requires 12-24 months of treatment. Surgery rarely is indicated in patients with Scheuermann's disease. Probably the 2 most common indications for surgery are spinal pain and unacceptable cosmetic appearance.","subject_name":"Orthopaedics","topic_name":"Avascular Necrosis & Osteochondroses"}

The hea valves can remain stretched and\/or scarred, and normal blood flow through damaged valves is interrupted. Blood may flow backward through stretched valves that do not close properly, or may be blocked due to scarred valves not opening properly. When the hea is damaged in this way, the hea valves are unable to function adequately, and hea surgery may be required. Untreated, RHD causes hea failure and those affected are at risk of arrhythmias, stroke, endocarditis and complications of pregnancy.

Grossly they are discrete multilobulated berrylike lesions that contain hemorrhage in various stages of evolution. Hemosiderin staining of the surrounding brain is seen.On CT: cavernous angiomas are usually isodense to moderately hyperdense on non-enhanced CTs. Calcification is common. Postcontrast enhancement varies from minimal to striking.On MR: A typical 'popcorn like lesion' surrounded by low signal hemosiderin rim is noted.Other intracranial vascular malformations:AV malformation:Arteriovenous malformations are a complex network of abnormal vascular channels consisting of an AVM nidus supplied by arterial feeders and drained by enlarged veins.In AVM there is no intervening capillary bed; i.e. the blood is directly being shunted from the arteries into the veins.Flow related aneurysms are seen in the AVM nidus or the feeding vessels. Vascular steal phenomenon may lead to ischemic and atrophic changes in the brain adjacent to the malformation.Imaging by CT and MR shows serpiginous vessels along with AVM nidus, which enhance strongly on contrast.Venous angioma:Venous angiomas are composed of radially arranged, dilated anomalous veins that converge in an enlarged transcortical or subependymal draining vein. Most often located near the margin of ventricle. Most common site is near frontal horn. Normal brain is interposed between the dilated veins.On angiography 'Medusa head' appearance consisting of dilated medullary veins converging into an enlarged 'collector' draining vein.On CECT and MR an enhancing tuft of rounded or linear vessels near the angle of a ventricle is seen. These enlarged medullary veins are seen to be draining into an enlarged draining vein.Vein of Galen malformation:The vein of Galen is a large deep vein at the base of the brain. It is located under the cerebral hemispheres and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the sinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa.VGM results from an aneurysmal malformation with an arteriovenous shunting of blood. VGM usually causes high- output heart failure in the newborn resulting from the decreased resistance and high blood flow in the lesion.Associated findings include cerebral ischemic changes such as strokes or steal phenomena that result in progressive hemiparesis.The malformation may result in mass effects, causing progressive neurological impairment. Alternatively, the malformation may cause obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow and result in hydrocephalus.Loud intracranial bruit may be heard because of the blood turbulence in VGM.The vein of Galen abnormality is the most frequent arteriovenous malformation in neonatesCT and MR show iso\/hyperdense posterior third ventricular mass which shows intense enhancement on postcontrast scans.

The price for this was considerable in terms of intensive care unit resources and ventilation dependent morbidity. Currently, treatment consists of oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) and physiotherapy. If a chest tube is in situ, intrapleural local analgesia can be used as well.

The two sites selected for this purpose constitue the ECG leads. Usually ECG is recoreded by 12 leads (12 lead ECG): - Three bipolar (standard) limb leads, three Unipolar limb leads and six unipolar chest leads.Bipolar (standard) limb leads or Einthoven's leado Bipolar recording involves recording of potential difference between two different sites on the body using two electrodes, one serving as the reference and the other called the exploring or active electrode. These leads are:-Lead I: - Between right arm (negative\/reference electrode) and left arm (positive or active or exploring electrode).LeadII: - Between right arm (negative or reference electrode) and left leg (positive electrode).Lead III: - Between left arm (negative electrode) and left leg (positive electrode).o The direction in wrhich positive electrode points is called the axis of lead. If the direction of the lead axis is similar to the direction of the flow of current in the heart, the recorded deflection is positive (upward). Hence electrodes are arranged in such a way that most of the deflections in the ECG are positive,o Einthoven's law Q: - This law states that if the electrical potential of any of the three bipolar limb leads are known at any given instant, the third one can be determined mathematically by simply summing the first two (but note that the positive and negative signs of different leads must be observed when making this summation). Thus the sum of the voltages in leads I and III equals the voltage in lead IIQ.Unipolar limb leadso Unipolar recording involves recording the potential difference between an active electrode and an indifference electrode. Thus, unipolar limb leads and chest leads employ an active electrode and an indifference electrode. The indifferent electrode is connected to left arm, right arm and left leg through a very high resistance (has been explained). Because of the high resistance, the indifferent electrode stays at an almost constant (zero) potential. Since the leads measure the potential difference between two electrodes, one of which is at constant voltage (indifferent), it essentially measures the potential at the other (active) electrode. There are three unipolar limb leads:-o VR : Between right arm and an indifferent electrode,o VL : Between left arm and an indifferent electrode,o VF: Between left leg and an indifferent electrode.o These unipolar limb leads are not much used in practice because augmented limb leads which provide a magnified version of the same information; therefore, unipolar augmented limb leads are used. Augmented limb leads are recordings between one limb and two other limbs12, i.e., the positive (active) electrode is connected to one limb and the negative electrode to the other two through high resistances. This results in an increase in the voltages recorded in the ECG That is why these leads are called augmented limb leads. There are three augmented limb leads: -aVR : - Between right arm (positive electrode) and left arm + left leg (negative or refrence electrode).aVL : - Between left arm (positive electrode) and right arm + Left leg (negative electrode).aVF : - Between left leg (positive electrode) and right arm + left arm (negative electrode).Unipolar chest leadsQo These leads emply an exploring (active or positive) electrode on the chest and an indifferent (reference or negative) electrode. The indifferent electrode is connected to the right arm, left arm and left leg through high resistances. The position of chest electrode (positive electrode) is as follows (VI - V6Q): -V1: In the right 4th intercostal space at the right border of the sternum.V2: In the left 4th intercostal space at the left border of sternum.V3: At midpoint between V2 and V4.V4: In the left 5th intercostal space in the midclavicuiar line.V5: In the left 5th intercostal space at the anterior axillary line.V6: In the left 5th intercostal space at the mid-axillary line.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Heart: Normal Electrocardiogram"}

Ca2+ influx through more slowly opening Ca2+ channels (the Ca2+ current, ICa) produces the plateau phase, and repolarization is due to net K+ efflux through multiple types of K+ channels.# Recorded extracellularly, the summed electrical activity of all the cardiac muscle fibers is the ECG.In phase 4 of action potential of cardiac muscle there exists a constant resting membrane potential of -85 to -90 mV. In pacemaker (SA node) fibres, however, the resting membrane potential is only of - 55 to -60. - Textbook Of Medical Physiology by Indu Khurana - Pg. 258.Salient features of pacemaker potential# The action potentials in the SA and AV nodes are largely due to Ca2+, with no contribution by Na+ influx.# Consequently there is no sharp, rapid depolarizing spike before the plateau, as there is in other parts of the conduction system and the atrial and ventricular fibers.# These are of two types in the heart, the T (for transient) channels and the L (for long-lasting) channels.# The calcium current (ICa) due to opening of T channels completes the prepotential, and ICa due to opening of L channels produces the impulse.Educational Table:MCQsAnsResting membrane potential depends onECF K+Resting membrane potentialEquilibrium potential of Cl-In resting and excitable tissues the most diffusible ion isCl-In resting and excitable tissues the least diffusible ion isNa+Magnitude of action potential is affected byECF Na+ ionsFreely permeable isWaterMost diffusible substance isUrea","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

The fluid expressed is called serum because all its fibrinogen and most of the other clotting factors have been removed; in this way, serum differs from plasma. Serum cannot clot because it lacks these factors. Platelets are necessary for clot retraction to occur. Therefore, failure of clot retraction is an indication that the number of platelets in the circulating blood might be low.\"Additional educational point:# Tissue factor initiates the extrinsic pathway, whereas contact of Factor XII and platelets with collagen in the vascular wall initiates the intrinsic pathway.# An especially important difference between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways is that the extrinsic pathway can be explosive; once initiated, its speed of completion to the final clot is limited only by the amount of tissue factor released from the traumatized tissues and by the quantities of Factors X, VII, and V in the blood. With severe tissue trauma, clotting can occur in as little as 15 seconds. The intrinsic pathway is much slower to proceed, usually requiring 1 to 6 minutes to cause clotting.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

But when rapid control of the ventricular rate is required to arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, a slow infusion of verapamil is the agent of choice. In general, verapamil may be added to digoxin or given intravenously while a digoxin effect is awaited, unless there is digitalis toxicity. In digitalis toxicity, lignocaine remains the agent of choice for ventricular arrhythmias, and is given in the same doses as for acute myocardial infarction; phenytoin is used for digitalis-arrhythmias with A-V block. Verapamil may be infused very cautiously for digitalis-induced supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. The use of oral agents such as quinidine, disopyramide and mexilitene for chronic prophylaxis of ventricular ectopic beats is of doubtful effectiveness, unless the ectopic activity is symptomatic. Serious ventricular arrhythmias may be induced by quinidine and disopyramide.

This most commonly results from long-standing hypeension, with eventual injury to the aeriolar walls. The result is increased permeability of the small vessels to fibrinogen and other plasma proteins, endothelial injury, and platelet deposition.

The ejection of the blood begins only after, opening of the A V valve and is preceeded by the time it takes for ventricular pressure to sufficiently exceed the Aortic and pulmonary diastolic pressure therefore there is the time interval between S1 and ejection click.o The interval between the S1 and the pulmonary ejection sound is directly related to the right ventricular isovolumic contraction time which is usually prolonged in pulmonary hypertension explaining a relative late occurrence of the ejection sound in these patients.o With increasing severity of pulmonary valve stenosis, the isovolumetric contraction shortens and the pulmonary ejection sound therefore tend to occur soon after S1.o In patient with very severe pulmonary stenosis, the ejection sound can fuse with S1 and max not he recognized.In severe pulmonary stenosis ejection click may be absent or it is very close to S1 because in severe pulmonary stenosis the increased Right ventricular pressure keeps the pulmonary' valve open before ventricular systole begins.","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":"Valvular Heart Disease"}

Sacubitril is also undergoing clinical testing for its role in the treatment of hypeension. Neprilysin (NEP) is an endopeptidase that metabolizes different vasoactive peptides especially natriuretic peptides including Atrial and Brain Natriuretic peptides thereby promoting diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilation. Sacubitril is a prodrug that once activated inhibits the enzyme Neprilysin, which is responsible for the degradation of atrial and brain natriuretic peptide. Sacubitril\/Valsaan: Angiotensin Receptor blocker-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI) combination: Sacubitril\/Valsaan is a first-in-class medicine that contains a Neprilysin (NEP) inhibitor (Sacubitril) and an Angiotensin II (Ang-II) receptor blocker (Valsaan) Neprilysin(NEP) is an endopeptidase that metabolize different vasoactive peptides including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin and Ang-II. NEP substrates may have biological opposing action and the total effect of the inhibition depends on the net effect of the individual metabolized substrates. Neprilysin inhibition not only increases the levels of both, natriuretic peptides (promoting diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilatation) but also increases the level of Ang-II (producing an opposite action of vasoconstriction and aldosterone release) The benefits of increasing the Natriuretic peptides (NP) system may thus be lost by increasing Ang-II, therefore a simultaneous suppression of the RAAS is necessary. Addition of Valsaan (angiotensin receptor blocker) blocks the undesirable effects of Ang-II (thereby reducing the undesirable effects of vasoconstriction and aldosterone release) Consequently, the ARNI is expected to promote the beneficial effects natriuresis, diuresis and vasodilatation of aerial and venous blood vessels and to inhibit thrombosis, fibrosis, cardiac myocyte hyperophy, and renin release.

Genetic susceptibility Primary lymphoedema can be familial or sporadic. In familial cases the genetic mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, recessive or x-linked pattern. In the last few years the application of Next Generation Sequencing, which allows identification of genetic mutations, even in sporadic cases and smaller families, has increased our understanding of the genetic basis of lymphoedema. So far, mutations in more than 20 genes have been linked to the development of primary lymphoedema. In individuals with familial mutations the penetrance of lymphoedema can often be incomplete leading to a large variability in clinical presentation. Involvement of other systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, digestive) is common and can indicate a specific mutation. Presence of isolated lower limb lymphedema at bih, classically described as Milroy's disease, suggests mutation in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4)\/ vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) or VEGF-C. In these patients, reduced initial uptake and presence of touous lymphatic tracts with evidence of rerouting in lymphangiography suggests mutation in the VEGF-C gene. lymphoedema can also be present as a minor sign in some well-recognised syndromes. Primary lymphoedema is present in less than 10% of cases of tuberous sclerosis (TSC1 and 2 gene mutations). Lymphoedema has been repoed in patients with Noonan syndrome in the presence of PTPN11, SOS1 or KRAS mutations, and in patients with Turner syndrome (monosomy X) and capillary malformation-aeriovenous malformation syndrome (RAS p21 protein activator 1 (RASA1) mutation).

Epinephrine is used along with local anesthetics at a concentration of 5 mg\/mL or 1:200,000. At this dose, epinephrine provides adequate vasoconstriction. It is added to local anesthetics to limit systemic absorption and the systemic side effects. It limits the diffusion of the drug away from the site thereby prolongs the duration of block and improves the depth of anesthesia. Epinephrine is also used to detect accidental intraaerial injection of a local anesthetic during the neuraxial block. The classic test dose combines local anesthetic and epinephrine, 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine. This epinephrine if injected intraaerially would increase the hea rate by 20% with or without the rise in blood pressure. Use of epinephrine can also enhance analgesia by acting on spinal a2 adrenergic receptors. The extent to which epinephrine prolongs the duration of anesthesia depends on the specific local anesthetic used and the site of injection. It can prolong the block caused by shoer acting agents as compared to longer acting ones. i.e. by adding epinephrine to lidocaine, the duration of the block is prolonged significantly than by the addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine.","subject_name":"Anaesthesia","topic_name":"Cardiopulmonary Cerebral Resuscitation"}

The second effect of increased renal aerial pressure that raises urine output is that it decreases the percentages of the filtered loads of sodium and water that are reabsorbed by the tubules. The mechanisms responsible for this effect include a slight increase in peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure, especially in the vasa recta of the renal medulla, and a subsequent increase in the renal interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure.

The Korotkoff sound method tends to give values for systolic pressure that are lower than the true intra-aerial pressure, and diastolic values that are higher. There is general consensus that the fifth phase or disappearance of sound should be taken as DBP, except in situations in which the disappearance of sounds cannot reliably be determined because sounds are audible even after complete deflation of the cuff, for example, in pregnant women, patients with aeriovenous fistulas and aoic insufficiency. The \"ideal\" cuff should have a bladder length that is 80% and a width that is at least 40% of arm circumference (a length-to-width ratio of 2:1). Cuff should be tied at the level of hea. Due to gravitational force BP decreases above the hea and increases below the hea by 0.77 mm Hg\/cm. For this reason, when measurements are taken in the supine position the arm should be suppoed with a pillow. In the sitting position, the right atrium level is the midpoint of the sternum or the fouh intercostal space. The lower end of the cuff should be 2 to 3 cm above the antecubital fossa to allow room for placement of the stethoscope. Recommended deflation rate: 2 to 3 mm Hg per second Blood pressure is measure falsely high when the cuff is too small relative to the patient's arm circumference. At the initial visit, blood pressure should be measured in both arms. The patient should be instructed to relax as much as possible and to not talk during the measurement procedure; ideally, 5 minutes should elapse before the first reading is taken. In older patients with a wide pulse pressure, the Korotkoff sounds may become inaudible between systolic and diastolic pressure, and reappear as cuff deflation is continued. This phenomenon is known as the auscultatory gap.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Cardiovascular System"}

The GSV is identified and dissected to the SFJ, which should be clearly established before the vein is divided to avoid disastrous inadveent transection of the superficial femoral vein. The anatomy is often variable but six GSV tributaries may be encountered close to the SFJ: Laterally: * superficial inferior epigastric vein; * superficial circumflex iliac vein; Medially: * superficial external pudendal vein; * deep external pudendal vein; Distally: * anterior accessory saphenous vein; * posteriomedial thigh vein. Classically, these are ligated distal to their divisions. A flush SFJ ligation is then performed and the GSV retrogradely stripped to around the knee. Phlebectomy is performed as discussed above. Closure of the cribriform fascia, with sutures or synthetic patches over the ligated SFJ, does not reduce groin recurrence. Stripping to the lowest point of reflux may improve results, but at a cost of increased saphenous nerve complications and is not widely performed. More recently, some surgeons argue that surgical trauma and subsequent inflammation in the groin is associated with neovascularisation, which in turn may lead to recurrence. Fuhermore, others hypothesise that it is the loss of the normal groin tributaries that may be responsible for driving the process of neovascularisation. These concepts have led some to believe that ligation of the refluxing vein should be distal to the tributaries and that the junction itself should be left untouched. There is no clear clinical evidence to suppo these hypotheses. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 981","subject_name":"Surgery","topic_name":"Vascular surgery"}

Diminution of a femoral and\/or popliteal pulse can often be appreciated by comparing it with its opposite number; however, pedal pulses are either clinically palpable or absent. Popliteal pulses are often difficult to feel; a popliteal aery aneurysm should be suspected if the popliteal pulse is prominent with concomitant loss of the natural concavity of the popliteal fossa. Pulsation distal to an aerial occlusion is usually absent although the presence of a highly developed collateral circulation may allow distal pulses to be palpable - this is most likely to occur with an iliac stenosis. In this case, exercise (walking until claudication develops) usually causes the pulse to disappear as vasodilation occurs below the obstruction, causing the pulse pressure to reduce. An aerial bruit, heard on auscultation over the pulse, indicates turbulent flow and suggests a stenosis. It is an unreliable clinical sign as tight stenoses often do not have bruits. A continuous 'machinery' murmur over an aery usually indicates an aeriovenous fistula.

CLINICAL BOX 5-7 Common Drugs That Act on Smooth Muscle Overexcitation of smooth muscle in the airways, such as that observed during an asthma attack, can lead to bronchoconstriction. Inhalers that deliver drugs to the conducting airway are commonly used to offset this smooth muscle bronchoconstriction, as well as other symptoms in the asthmatic airways. The rapid effects of drugs in inhalers are related to smooth muscle relaxation. Rapid response inhaler drugs (eg, Ventolin, albuterol, sambuterol) frequently target b-adrenergic receptors in the airway smooth muscle to elicit a relaxation. Although these b-adrenergic receptor agonists targeting the smooth muscle do not treat all symptoms associated with asthma (eg, inflammation and increased mucus), they act rapidly and frequently allow for sufficient opening of the conducting airway to restore airflow and thus allow for other treatments to reduce airway obstruction. Smooth muscle is also a target for drugs developed to increase blood flow. As discussed in the text, NO is a natural signaling molecule that relaxes smooth muscle by raising cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This signaling pathway is naturally downregulated by the action of phosphodiesterase (PDE), which transforms cGMP into a non-signaling form, GMP. The drugs sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil are all specific inhibitors of PDE V, an isoform found mainly in the smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum of the penis (see Chapters 25 and 32). Thus, oral administration of these drugs can block the action of PDE V, increasing blood flow in a very limited region in the body and offsetting erectile dysfunction. EDRF was later identified as the gaseous second messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO).Ref: Ganong&;s Review of medical physiology 25th edition.

Systolic hea failure, which is an impairment in contractility, has a better response to positive inotropic agents. Most patients have a combination of both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.In diastolic hea failure, filling of the left ventricle is slow or incomplete (i.e., decreased compliance) unless left atrial pressures increase to maintain the ejection fraction at the expense of increasing pulmonary and systemic venous congestion. Clinical findings include dyspnea, which is the most common symptom, resulting from interstitial and pulmonary edema. Pathophysiologically, there is left atrial hypeension and pulmonary venous hypeension, leading to pulmonary congestion. Therapy is aimed at slowing the hea rate, which promotes filling of the left ventricle at low pressures. -Adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers are effective. Patients with diastolic dysfunction have a better survival rate than those with systolic dysfunction, because the ejection fraction is normal to slightly decreased, albeit at the expense of increased left atrial pressures.Systolic dysfunction is an impairment in contractility of the left ventricle or a defect in the ability ofmyofibrils to shoen against a load. The left ventricle loses its ability to eject blood into the aoa, so the ejection fraction (i.e., stroke volume\/left ventricular end-diastolic volume) is decreased (usually < 40%); the normal ejection fraction is 80\/120, or 66%, with a range of 55% to 75%. The ejection fraction is measured by echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography. Signs of isolated systolic dysfunction include fatigue, prerenal azotemia, cool skin, and mental obtundation. The left ventricular chamber eventually dilates and patients develop fatigue, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, which are signs of right-sided hea failure. Examples of systolic dysfunction include post-myocardial infarction, ischemic injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction), and congestive cardiomyopathy. Therapy is aimed at improving the performance of the left ventricle with the administration of positive inotropic agents and peripheral vasodilators to decrease peripheral resistance.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Cardiovascular system"}
{"id":"ee50252a-7815-464b-8b73-e5dfd334a0a0","question":"Which of the following increases capillary filling rate?","opa":"Increased capillary filling co-efficient","opb":"Reduced plasma colloidal osmotic pressure","opc":"Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure.","opd":"All of the above","cop":1,"choice_type":"multi","exp":"Ans. B. Reduced plasma colloidal osmotic pressure. (Ref. Ganong 23rd\/pg. 592 - 594)# Net fluid movement depends on net driving pressure and two other important factors related to the properties of the membranes. The filtration coefficient ,Kf, depends on the surface area and the permeability of the capillary wall to water (hydraulic conductivity). Leaky capillaries (e.g., due to histamine) have a high Kf. Glomerular capillaries have a high Kf, needed for their function.# The potential causes of pulmonary edema and pleural effusion are increases in capillary hydrostatic pressure, increases in interstitial colloid osmotic pressure, decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Edema due to hydrostatic pressure is called cardiogenic edema. Edema due to osmotic pressure and membrane properties is called non- cardiogenic pulmonary edema.Fluid Filtration Across Capillaries Is Determined by Hydrostatic and Colloid Osmotic Pressures, and Capillary Filtration CoefficientFour primary forces that determine whether fluid will move out of the blood into the interstitial fluid or in the opposite direction. These forces, called \"Starling forces \" in honor of the physiologist who first demonstrated their importance:1) The capillary pressure (Pc), which tends to force fluid outward through the capillary membrane.2) The interstitial fluid pressure (Pif), which tends to force fluid inward through the capillary membrane when Pif is positive but outward when Pif is negative.3) The capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure (Pp), which tends to cause osmosis of fluid inward through the capillary membrane.4) The interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (Pif), which tends to cause osmosis of fluid outward through the capillary membrane.If the sum of these forces, the net filtration pressure, is positive, there will be a net fluid filtration across the capillaries. If the sum of the Starling forces is negative, there will be a net fluid absorption from the interstitial spaces into the capillaries. Net filtration from systemic capillaries is dependent on the Starling forces and capillary permeability. Equation is:Net filtration = Kf where Kf is the filtration coefficient of the membrane, and is directly proportional to capillary permeability, Pcapillary and Ptissue are the hydrostatic pressures in the capillary and tissue (interstitial space), respectively, and pcapillary and ptissue are the osmotic (colloid oncotic) pressures in the capillary and interstitial space, respectively. Increasing central venous pressure increases the capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pcapillary), which increases the filtration of fluid from the systemic capillaries, leading to edema.The movement of fluid between vascular and interstitial spaces is controlled mainly by the opposing effects of vascular hydrostatic pressure and plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Normally, the exit of fluid into the interstitium from the arteriolar end of the microcirculation is nearly balanced by inflow at the venular end; the lymphatics drain a small residual amount of excess interstitial fluid. Either increased capillary pressure or diminished colloid osmotic pressure can result in increased interstitial fluid,n Increased Hydrostatic PressureLocalized increases in intravascular pressure can result from impaired venous return; if the failing heart cannot increase cardiac output, the extra fluid load causes increased venous pressure and, eventually, edema.# Reduced Plasma Osmotic PressureCapillary hydrostatic and osmotic forces are normally balanced so that there is no net loss or gain of fluid across the capillary bed. However, increased hydrostatic pressure or diminished plasma osmotic pressure leads to a net accumulation of extravascular fluid (edema). If the ability of the lymphatics to drain tissue fluid is exceeded, persistent tissue edema results.# Effect of Abnormal Imbalance of Forces at the Capillary MembraneIf the mean capillary pressure rises above 17 mm Hg, the net force tending to cause filtration of fluid into the tissue spaces rises. Thus, a 20 mm Hg rise in mean capillary pressure causes an increase in net filtration pressure from 0.3 mm Hg to 20.3 mm Hg, which results in 68 times as much net filtration of fluid into the interstitial spaces as normally occurs. To prevent accumulation of excess fluid in these spaces would require 68 times the normal flow of fluid into the lymphatic system, an amount that is 2 to 5 times too much for the lymphatics to carry away. As a result, fluid will begin to accumulate in the interstitial spaces, and edema will result.Conversely, if the capillary pressure falls very low, net reabsorption of fluid into the capillaries will occur instead of net filtration, and the blood volume will increase at the expense of the interstitial fluid volume.Note: Approximately 60% of lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular and the remainder is in extracellular compartments, mostly as interstitial fluid; only 5% of total body water is in blood plasma.","subject_name":"Physiology","topic_name":"Heart, Circulation, and Blood"}

As the vitreous shrinks, it becomes somewhat stringy, and the strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina.In most cases, floaters are part of the natural aging process and simply an annoyance. Over time, they tend to settle to the bottom of the eye, becoming less bothersomeFloaters are more likely to develop as we age and are more common in people who are very nearsighted, have diabetes, or who have had previous eye surgeryQ.There are other, more serious causes of floaters, including infection, inflammation (uveitis), hemorrhaging, retinal tears, and injury to the eye.People with diabetes tend to have more floaters because high blood glucose alters the chemical composition of the vitreous, causing it to shrink more rapidly. Also, people with diabetes are more likely to have bleeding inside the eyes as a result of diabetic retinopathy, and patients will sometimes visualize individual red blood cells floating around within their vitreous (sort of looks like hundreds of discrete, little peppercorns.)Patients with severe diabetic retinopathy (proliferative diabetic retinopathy) are especially at risk for a retinal detachment, as abnormal blood %ressels growing into the vitreous are more firmly attached to the retina, pulling it away as the vitreous shrinks (like wall paper being pulled off a wall). If left untreated, a retinal detachment can lead to permanent visual impairment or blindness within a few' days or even hours.Sometimes, a section of the vitreous pulls away (detaches) from the retina all at once, rather than gradually, causing many new floaters to appear suddenly. This is called a vitreous detachment, w'hich in most cases is not sight- threatening and requires only close observation, not treatment.However, a sudden increase in floaters, possibly accompanied by light flashes or peripheral (side) vision loss, could indicate a retinal detachmentFig.: illustration of a floater within the vireousposterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is a condition of the eye in which the vitreous humour separates from the retina","subject_name":"Ophthalmology","topic_name":"Vascular Disorders"}

Medical useEdit Irregular heabeatEdit The most common indications for digoxin are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, though beta blockers and\/or calcium channel blockers are often preferred. There is tentative evidence that digoxin may increase the risk of death, though another meta-analysis in 2015 repoed no change in moality. Hea failureEdit Digoxin is no longer the first choice for hea failure; it has fallen out of or in people with hea failure because it may increase the risk of death. Currently, the recommendation for hea failure is a triple therapy of ACE inhibitor, beta blocker and mineralocoicoid antagonists. Digoxin is a third-line therapy. AboionEdit Digoxin is also used intrafetally or amniotically during aboions in the late second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy. It typically causes fetal demise(measured by cessation of cardiac activity) within hours of administration. Side effectsEdit Main aicle: List of side effects of digoxin Fuher information: Digoxin toxicity The occurrence of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks as a side effect, thought to be due to the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the digoxin molecule, but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal as of 2005.
